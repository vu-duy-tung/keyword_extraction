Although space is at a premium, the staff are helpful, the portions are well sized and the food is lovel, especially the chicken fajtas and the nachos.   if you are looking for somewhere to have a quick lunch or have a relaxing, cosy evening meal i would definitely recommend you try this place - but i would makesure you book if you're trying to go on a friday or saturday night!",

The food is warming, authentic, simple and cheap and there's always loads of it. It's a tiny space-but this just adds to the atmosphere. Staff are friendly and keen to help you choose from the brilliant menu. This is a lovely place to roll our of warmed up, well fed and dosed up with Tequilla in a cold Edinburgh night. Perfect!",

I have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed, staff are friendly and its small enough to have a big personality. The food is fantastic, there's always lots of it and the prices are reasonable There are a couple of good vegetarian options but my personal favourites are the HUGE topped Nachos (lush) If you have any room left, try the Key Lime Pie or Sticky Toffee Pudding, both are yummy. Miros is licenced and has an impressive selection of Tequilas you can try - including one with a worm - go on be brave - its an aphrodisiac apparently...",

We started with the nachos which were pretty good and then had the quesadillas which were probably the best quesadillas I've ever had. My parents had the veggie enchiladas and I had the Mexican stack. Both were amazing. I recommend anyone go there. The place is small so finding a table is hard but it's well worth it.",

I'd like it to be crispy outside but softer inside. The ice cream and thick chocolate sauce were great though.",

The nachos at Dirty Dicks down the street are far superior, and its nowhere near Mexican. Miros is just okay.",

We didn't have much experience dining at this hour in the city and didn't realize that reservations were critical. We were turned away from the other places that looked interesting but when we stuck our heads in here, the staff were great. They had a table that was open for 45 minutes and offered it to us as long as we were out on time.  Our meal wasn't rushed in spite of the time constraints in part due to the great service. This place is really small and you end up in close quarters with the other patrons but you feel more cozy than cramped. The small size helps the service because you're never more than a few feet away from the staff.  We ordered appetizers which were a good amount of food and good. I ordered the meatball dish. It was served a little hot (temp not spice) for my preference. The food was good, I've eaten a lot of Mexican food and this was unique and interesting but True to the flavor profiles of the cuisine.  The price was reasonable and the decor was fitting and quirky. The food was above average and the staff was great, we'd certainly go back if we're in the area again.",

    "text": "Miros Cantina was one of the few mexican places in edinburgh that i hadn't paid a visit to in my quest for the best tex mex this city has to offer.  so when it was suggested for a work night out, i was looking forward to trying out what was on offer.  i had a few doubts as the yelp reviews put it as mediocre and i have to say it did live up that expectation...  we were a large party so they offered to let us order of a special set menu.  this included a tapas style selection of starters, a small glass of frozen margartia on arrival, about 6-7 main dishes to choose from, and the option of dessert/tea or coffee/shot of tequila to end.  the menu was reasonably priced at 21.95 for the three courses and margartia (however with an added pitcher of margarita and two bottles of wine i ended up paying 32 instead...)  the highlight of my meal was probably the starters.  we were brought two huge plates of nachos with all the toppings, two chicken quesadillas, a dish of fried chorizo and onions, and plain tortilla chips with salsa, guacamole, and some other dip i couldn't identify.  we were starving and dove right in and i can confirm that the nachos were awesome!  maybe it was my extreme hunger talking but these were some of the best i'd ever had.  loads of melted cheese and toppings and they were sat on top of a bed of delicious refried beans.  i definitely made sure to eat my fair share of these.  i found the chorizo a bit oily, but the quesadilla was quite yummy and the tortilla chips were of good standard.  i also think that the salsa and guacamole was homemade.  for mains i had the spinach, artichoke, and mushroom fajitas which sounded like a better concept than what it tasted like.  sadly the spinach made the whole thing super watery and there just wasn't enough of the artichoke and mushrooms to make a decent fajita.  i also think i was a bit full up from the delicious nachos so my main being a bit less than awesome just left me with disappointment and a sore belly from too much food.  i opted for a cup of tea to finish but i was told that the pecan pie was lovely and not heavy at all.  so if i head back here i may have to give that a try.  overall, miros cantina was ok.  it wasn't my favourite tex mex place as i wasn't a fan of my main course and the whole place felt a wee bit run down and in the need of a good refurbishmnet.  however, the starters were good, the service was friendly, and the margaritas were of good quality so if suggested as a dinner option i would likely go back.",

The ceviche was shellfish-heavy, with not enough fish - it seemed like a value pack of seafood mix, covered in some lime juice. It did come with lovely fresh salad and ripe avocado, and crunchy corn chips.  I had a fish taco for my main and, again, it was just a plain fillet of fish wrapped in a tortilla with some peppers and onions. Fresh, healthy, tasty, and a wee bit dull. And served with boil in the bag rice...  Shame. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good.",

Situated in Rose Street, Cantina Mexicana is right in the centre of the city and it is just around the corner from the main shopping street in Edinburgh, Princes Street and so it is a convenient place to reach.   This restaurant is fairly small inside, but it is very colourfully decorated inside, guaranteed to make you smile after a difficult day. Cantina Maxicana's menu offers an expansive menu of authentic Mexican dishes which are all freshly cooked. I love to come here for my dinner, and I have been known to dine here alone if none wants to come with me it - I love this place that much! I am completely obsessed with their chili con queso - a spicy cheese dip - which tastes amazing. Their main courses include nachos, quesadillas, enchiladas and tacos. I also adore their chicken fajitas which are cooked perfectly and are served with guacamole, salsa, cheese and sour cream, although they are a wee bit pricey at 13.   Mexican beers are also sold here, along with tequila and margaritas. Cantina Mexicana is my favourite Mexican restaurant and you want to experience the full Mexican experience, this is definitely worth a visit.",

Also has a good tequila menu which is my favourite and its hard to find good tequila in the UK.  I have met the owner a few times and she is always very friendly and gives exceptional service. The nachos are really good and they are massive! The lunch special is my favourite though because its a burrito with all the fixings for cheap. The only drawback is the place is quite small and will fill up quickly . There has been times I have arrived hoping to find a spot only to see its packed like a can of sardines!

The lunch menu is a great deal with burritos and quesadillas plus a beer for just over a fiver! Inside it is decorated almost like a crazed bazaar with floral table cloths and loads of interesting things on the walls. There is upbeat Mexican music and friendly staff to give this wee place a real buzz. That specials board is where to look if you want to venture beyond the usual enchilada-based mains and get a taste of the distinctive flavours of regional 'platos tipicos'.  The lamb is cooked for seven hours with honey and smoked chipotle chillis, and the cochinita pibil (Yucatan inspirered slow roasted pork) is amazing. The search for authenticity extends to the wine list where a Mexican petit syrah is one of nine offered by the glass. For dessert, the usual brownie/pecan configurations are trumped by a rum-soaked pineapple kebab with melted dark chocolate for dipping. I didn't try that but another table had it and it looked pretty good. Great for lunch - definitely my favorite in the area.",

I didn't get a chance to try the margheritas, although I did spend most of the night gazing longingly at them over my Merlot.

I was in the mood for a Chimichanga, but that wasn't on the menu. *sigh*  We had nachos and Goat cheese, peppers and sweet chilli jam Quesadillas for starters. The nachos were about as good as nachos can be, and the Quesadillas were delicious!! *drool*   My mother had PAELLA MEXICANA, my sister had fish in a soft taco or tortiilla (cant remember) and I had BORREGO CON MIEL, which is slow cooked shredded lamb with honey & smoked chilli, shredded and served with warm tortillas.  My mother enjoyed her food and was actually struggling to eat it all, which means they really give generous helpings. My sister didn't like her taco at all unfortunately, and said she should have known a fish taco would be a bad idea.   I enjoyed my lamb, but not sure if it was such a good idea either. I've never had lamb prepared with honey and it may have been too sweet for me. I started feeling a bit sick, but luckily with the yummy Margaritas we had to wash the food down, all was good! hehe  Even though it was nice, I doubt I'd go back again. It felt too small and claustrophobic for me. I like a restaurant where I have enough space to find a nice corner to hide in while I eat in peace. :-)  It was a nice little restaurant with good food, great Margaritas, a very friendly and helpful waitress and pleasant Mexican atmosphere.",

Here you'll find all the typical Mexican fare: Quesadillas, Enchiladas, Fajitas etc. Beers include Dos Equis, Negra Modelo et al. Fairly standard so far...  Where the Cantina Mexicana aims to differentiate itself from its competition is the specials. The Borrego con meil (a slow cooked lamb dish with a honey/chilli sauce) and Cazuela (a chicken and Chorizo casserole) are both delicious and highlight the value of choosing something a little different as appose to the 'usuals'.   Backing all this up is the cost: it's wallet friendly prices (7 for the afore mentioned specials) ensure a solid dining experience.    Be sure to book or get in there early at the weekend as it will be rammed!",

Sure enough within the hour we we seated in a lovely if a little cramped table by the window. Restaurant has a lovely atmosphere and the staff were friendly and attentive upon arrival. I was most content at this point. I ordered the chicken fajitas without cheese, but was promised extra salsa. However upon delivery of the dish, there was no extra salsa and a full bowl of cheese, which made me feel slightly queasy due to my severe cheese allergy. My gf ordered the lamb, she was delighted with the cheese error, as she is a big cheese fan and she commented that this error would make her dining experience even better. She was very happy with the lamb, it melted in her mouth and she couldn't get enough of it. Overall the food was good and we would definitely come back. A major plus is the location of the restaurant, as is slap bang in the middle of the main shopping area and there are plenty of pubs nearby for a drop of local whisky or a pint of Guinness.",

The music was great playing a selection of latin american old and new tunes.   We started off with a bottle of mexican red wine and would recomend this as it was most delicious.   Next we ordered a medium nachos between two which came with loads of gaucamole, salsa (quite spicy I found) and cheese. But very tasty and my partner finished the entire plate even though I ate not much (not a fan of nachos myself). Next we had lamb with honey (the best lamb I have ever tasted) and spicy chicken with chorizo all served with rice and tortillas. Given that we had stuffed ourselves and drank most of the wine we felt the need for desert of cheesecake and mexican hot chocolate boht of which were up to the standard of the rest of the meal.

We ordered Nachos to share which were the size of a small child and quite possibly the best I'd ever had. My main course was/were pretty excellent chicken fajitas with patatas del Puebla on the side (basically spicy mash) which I couldn't finish as the portion size was humongous. My other half, a devil for punishment, ordered the churros for dessert which she declared to be very, very good. A very potable Verdejo rounded off an excellent meal and we waddled into the night vowing to return whoever we came back to Edinburgh and, failing that, recommending it to anyone reading this. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I visited Miros in a group of 10 last night, it's a cosy little restaurant, we were tightly squeezed around a long table but I guess it was the best way to get 10 seated in a small, busy place.  The staff were friendly and very accommodating. One member of our party was an hour late, they let us order starters and drinks until he got there and said they didn't need the table back by a certain time. This was very nice of them. We must have been seated for 2 and a half, almost 3 hours which was great as it was a catch up with folk who hadn't seen each other in quite some time.   So we ordered some starters while we waited and everyone's looked great! I felt some were a little pricey for a starter, upwards or 6.95 for a few prawns. That being said, I had.the BEST NACHOS!! Seriously, the nachos were incredible. 3.50 for a small portion that was actually really hearty! Sitting on a bed of refried beans say what definitely felt like freshly fried tortilla chips, topped with salsa, guacamole, jalapenos, a nice strong but melty cheese and sour cream. They had assembled them in a way each chip was topped well but has not gone soggy. Honestly, they were perfect!  Unfortunately because my starter was so filling I struggled with my main. I wish I hadn't as it was delicious! My boyfriend did manage to finish every last drop that I couldn't eat. It was a lovely spiced fish stew which came with rice and two soft tortillas. The stew it's self was packed full of seafood, mussels, king prawns, small shrimp, white fish, squid! All perfectly cooked and sitting in a rich, tomato sauce.  And at 13.50 it was actually pretty reasonable for a fish dish.  I started the evening with a good old frozen margarita, didn't taste like it had much alcohol in it, but it was really nice. The waiting staff ensured we had plenty of drinks, checked everything was ok but not in the overbearing way. All round it was a great experience with great food. There are stacks of Mexicans around Edinburgh, but if you're in the area I'd definitely give this one a go. Next time I'm just going to get a mountain of nachos ;)",

But, on a lazy Sunday venture yesterday, my boyfriend remembered his boss recommending this place so we decided to give it a go after looking at the menu on-line.   Walking it, I was almost immediately sold, the very tiny space with brightly colored tablecloths and an eclectic mix of things you would normally see in a Mexican restaurant. Their is very little seating space, and it was packed for a Sunday afternoon. I decided to go with the vegetarian burrito special and my partner opted for the steak and caramelized onion taco. We also started with a small nacho and low and behold I was SO excited to find they serve a michelada! It will sound disgusting to most, but I had totally been craving one and it is essentially a bloody mary, but with beer, and I love it with Pacifico. The beer came with my burrito for a grand total of 8.00!   The nachos came quickly and they are so delicious. Great cheese and chips, everything was fresh and the refried beans were so nice, not greasy, but just right! Plenty of guacamole and salsa on top, with sour cream and plenty of cheese! They were busy, so our food came a bit after, which was fine considering our beers and nachos. The burrito was huge, served with a small fresh salad with pickled red onions (something I love to have in Mexican food) and the burrito was filled with sort of a veggie bean chili with rice and a very tasty tortilla. The taco my partner had looked equally nice and fresh and he said the steak was very nicely marinated and good.   The service also was very nice and the meal was thoroughly enjoyable. It has a nice, casual atmosphere and on a semi-sunny day I could have almost pretended I wasn't in Edinburgh. I will definitely be going back to try other things, as they also serve ceviche, tacos, enchiladas and margaritas! It may not be spot on 100% pure Mexican as some might hope for, but the atmosphere and food definitely did not disappoint and it was nice to see it full of people all chowing down, it was such a nice lunch and I would recommend this to anyone!",

Miros Cantina is a stone's throw from the office, so perfect for feeling like you've treated yourself to a lunch out, whilst being able to nip back before the end of your lunch hour.  We both plumped for enchilladas, these were okay. Fairly small portion size (only one each), but with spicy rice and salad. A decent size for your lunch when you don't want to fill up too much. I mean, I'm not saying it was amazing, but it hit the spot in that way that only Mexican food can.  And if I didn't have to go back to work that afternoon I'd have been all over their frozen margaritas!",

You will notice this place straight away from the outside to be a Mexican restaurant.  We popped in on a Monday night and were lucky to get a table. We waited for about 10 min until the table was ready for us. Next door was a pub so we went there until we received a call that our table was ready. The staff was very nice and attentative. It's quite a small place so I can recommend you make a reservation.  I ordered enchiladas as a main and it was a bit different than usual from other Mexican restaurants. It came served on a very hot plate, cheese melted on top of beef mince with a tiny portion of rice served on the side as well as a very spicy salad. The iced lime Margarita tasted delicious. The longer you wait the more liquid it becomes.  I ordered olives as a starter,  which comes with Tortillas and bread. Delicious!  The toilets are very small, hardly any space to maneuver.  Will I be back? Yes, for sure!",

Not only will it satisfy you but it will leave you wanting more of that addictive cheese dip for example. And you will be rolling out of the restaurant as they generous with the portions!

Waiting staff were very distracted and all though we had a tight squeeze at our table it was not busy. The mains were ok but not strong on flavour and more what I would expect at a burger place throwing in a few tex-mex type dishes not a standalone Mexican restaurant. The guacamole was thin and at best inoffensive but the margaritas were woeful. In fact I kept asking for more wedges of lime and battered in with the salt (it was so sweet?!) to try and resuscitate it, but it had already shuffled of this mortal coil. Maybe we got them on an off night or with new staff but they'll be no hasta la vista for me.",

Starters, main, dessert (or tequila or coffee) and a frozen lime margarita but for 25.70 each.  Slightly dearer than Robyn's offer for some reason, perhaps because there were only 8 people in our party and Robyn went with more people?  Starters arrived and everyone delved into the nachos with all the works, chicken quesadillas, nachos with cheese dip and chorizo in a red wine sauce. Like Robyn, we all filled up heartily on the starters, (a case of eye too big for our bellies, I think) that by the time our main course came we were all stuffed!  Many people took home doggy bags of their main course, having only nibbled the edge of it!  I had ordered salmon off the specials board, not very Mexican I know, but I wanted something lighter after the starter selection.  In fact the only Mexican element about the dish was it was served with a tortilla, however it was very tasty.  Too full to face dessert, several of us ordered the tequila instead - well, it was a hen party after all!  It was only the house tequila, but still a refreshing (?!?) end to the meal!  The staff were busy but polite.  The restaurant itself is fairly small and feels a bit tight for space.  There is only one toilet and the flush wasn't working.  The decor is trying to be old style Mexicano shanty restaurant, but it could do with an update.  Generally ok, but not the best Mexican I've had.",
