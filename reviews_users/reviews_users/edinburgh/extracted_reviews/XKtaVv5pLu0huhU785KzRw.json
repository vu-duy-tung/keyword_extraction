    "text": "It seems to be a place on trend with the \"street food\" revolution that is appearing on every high street. It is fast food with a Tex-Mex spin. As we sat there we saw plenty of locals dropping by for lunch - usually a good sign.   The food was well cooked and what you would expect from fast food cafe. The portion size is fair for the price. All in all, if you like Tex-Mex, it is what you would expect and done well.",

    "text": "Was looking for some quick Mexican late Friday night. And I can always go for a shake. On the positive side, it was fairly quick. But it was not really Mexican. Greasy, skimpy on the toppings, and missing 5/8 shake flavors.   Also, as a general rule I should know better than to eat at a place that serves Mexican, Pizza, Burgers, Smoothies, and Middle Eastern food. Now you should too.",

    "text": "The concept off Burrito n' Shake is one I find fascinating. I love mexican food and funnily enough milkshakes (despite being lactose intolerant). When I went with my friend a month or two ago, we ordered nachos, fries and milkshakes between us. The fries and milkshake were really good. Additionally, the service and those that work there were really nice. However, the nachos were a little dry - I don't know how to describe it. The top layer of confectionarys and toppings were really good, but there was just a bottom layer of plain dry yet soggy nachos didn't add to the up to that point very good experience. But honestly that's just me nit picking. If you are hungry for some mexican it's definitely a place to check out!",

Took us 3 hours to motivate out of our bed to get a meal that we might be able to stomach. Turns out we jumped the gun and the boys all nuked the little girls room. Our cashier had an nose ring and an eyebrow piercing which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars. Don't go here.",
