    "text": "Biddy's is very hit or miss, seemingly depending on how drunk you are.  As a pre drinking venue, it is good. Plenty of space for larger groups, and the drinks prices are very reasonable considering it is on the Grassmarket. It supports the Student Recommended Card which is handed out to Edinburgh students during Freshers Week or available at the bar upon flashing your student card. This offers students great deals such as vodka and mixer for 1.95.   However (this is where I disagree with some of the other reviews), this place is not suited at all for a quiet drink.  The interior is minimalistic and dull, and as result there is next to no character inside this pub.  The music played is just loud enough to make conversation a chore.  Also if you go during busy times such as Friday and Saturday nights, you will be subjected to very drunk people stumbling into one another, fights and bucket loads of sleazy men trying to hit on young females.   Overall, great as a quick stop off and meeting point before heading to one of the nearby clubs on a night out, but if it's a quiet few drinks you're after, you'd be much better off heading to one of the other pubs on Grassmarket such as Last Drop or White Hart Inn.",

    "text": "A firm favourite with students and locals alike, this Irish themed pub situated in Edinburghs popular Grassmarket area is the ideal location to start a boozy night.   In truth not more than a danke little pub 10 years overdue a revamp with sticky floors, overcrowding and a toliet that always smells of stale pee but this just adds to the great atmosphere Biddy's has.   The front, circular bar offers your run of the mill spirits with great drink promo's for students on various nights. The staff are friendly and efficient leaving no glass uncollected and more than happy to dish out the free pints of water when you've had a few too many   In the back area you will find another bar and a makeshift stage with PA system. Many fun times are to be had dancing along to the live Irish Jig band with a pint of Guiness in your hand.   Always busy at the weekends and usually very rowdy. So if you don't want the noise and would rather not rough it in jeans and a t-shirt you're best to avoid this place. That said, Doormen enforce a strict ID policy and the staff are quick to eliminate anyone making a nuisance of themselves so you won't be surrounded by annoying fannies!   All in all great fun and perfect for venturing along the Cowgate or to the mighty Liquid Rooms which is conviently situated just around the corner.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure if I should give this place three or four stars... four stars on week nights but more like 2 stars on weekends... I think I'll stick with four because everwhere sucks on weekends and it's not Biddy's fault!  I used to be obsessed with this place.  Ok \"obsessed\" might be a little strong but what I mean is that I lived 5 minutes away, the beer was really cheap (student recommends deals ... which, by the way stop at 11pm and the staff never said a word when we each bought 3 pints at 10:55... sometimes they'd just give us the deal even if it was after 11.  That's what I call love), and there's live music on nearly every night of the week.  My friends and I started coming here regularly when we developed a somewhat overly-extreme crush on the guy who plays there Tuesday nights (Matt).  Then one night Matt switched with his brother Andy (who plays Mondays) and the love bloomed.  Basically Matt and Andy are awesome musicians and Biddy's is a fantastic place for hosting their talent.  Other than the music, I have to admit the food here is pretty damn good too.  Ok so I've only had the steak and ale pie and the fajitas but OMG the fajitas are amazing and I want one right now.  My friend Mel and I used to go there for dinner whenever we were hungover.. mmmmm.  The food's got a student deal too so it's 2 for 1.    Biddy's is, however, extremely shitty on the weekends because it's in the Grassmarket near the Cow Gate and it is therefore full of loud drunken twats from about 6pm onwards Friday and Saturday nights.  This is extremely unfortunate, but it's week-day coolness makes up for that.",

Indeed (as many other reviews have stated) the bonus with this pub is the discounts available with an Student Recommended card (SR Card).  With this handy piece of plastic you can bag a number of cheap drinks. Although you'll get nothing special (no ales on tap here). Nonetheless, everyone likes cheap cider, right? The central oval bar and rickety character add to the pubs charm too.",

It's really nice to sit outside here in the summer with a cider and watch the world go by.

Now, sitting in the corner with the boy and a bunch of hammered university students, I can see the attraction... it's a great student pub. But if you're middle aged, sagging, and like drinking more for the taste than a pleasure akin to being on a ship in a storm, then bugger than, plenty of other opportunities. As for cheap, our two drinks came to a hefty 8 quid (with warm Magners at that...) - if that's cheap, then I'm glad I was a student in the 90's, and not the naughties or later.",

But it was always pretty good.  I think the appeal was the SR card which gives you cheaper drinks. Compared to the other bars that accept the SR card, I prefer Biddys. It attracts a good crowd. Granted it can get very busy with stag do's or Irish people watching the Rugby, but it doesn't ever get too over the top and maintains a good atmosphere.   During the week there is live music. It can be hit or miss, if it's good it adds to the atmosphere. Just a good, fun bar which is reasonably cheap.",

Went up to order my fajitas and a burger and the bartender asked if we were students, I said I am... and he asked to see my student ID and BAM! 2-for-1 deal on our meals! so we got our food for 7.50 pounds! what?! hahaha i love unexpected deals. that alone bumped their rating to a 3,  but the extra star comes from how good the food was for the value! They give such a big portion of fajitas and only 4 torillas?! hahaha sad. you can ask for extra though i suppose... but really, fajitas were yummy! the burger was ok. their meat tastes different compared to meat here in the US, but it's a good thing according to my friends who ate it.  I must mention that we came here on a Wednesday at 2pm, so it wasn't crowded at all.  The place was clean and staff polite! If I was in Edinburgh, I'd definitely come back here!!! Love it!",

Students enjoy drinks for 2 quid - but you have to tell them you're a student and show ID or they'll charge you the normal price every time. There are a ton of Stag and Hen parties that take place here which can be a good or bad thing dependent on how belligerent they are.   The only True negative thing I have against Biddy's itself is the barstaff. They tend to be pretty slow, just hang out and not serve, or skip over people that have been waiting the longest. The other ups and downs I can't really hold against Biddy's - but I can say I've had a fun time everytime I've visited.",

Unfortunately, we were wrong. :-/  It started with the service: very, very slow. Maybe they were understaffed today or something, but it took forever to get our drink orders in and then even longer to place our food order. The menu for Sunday brunch was very basic, and even so, they were out of almost half the menu.   I ended up ordering the bacon and Irish cheddar cheese omelette, which was good, though a bit greasy. The cheese was really yummy though.  Oh: and, our tables were super sticky and gross and that was nasty. We didn't want to touch them which is not fun... nobody wants to eat in a restaurant that doesn't feel clean.  Oh: and my friend ordered the full Irish breakfast, but they still charged her extra for the toast. And we had to get up and go to the bar and pick the bread out of a basket and put it in the toaster and stand there and wait for it to toast and then pop it out of the toaster and put it on a plate and bring it back to the table. And they served flavorless margarine with it! So for self-service toast with no good at salted Irish butter (hello, it's an Irish pub!), this was all extremely disappointing.",

Biddys can give a bit of a cold feeling as it's dark and has low ceilings, it makes you think of an old man with his Guinness after coming in from the rain! Usually, however, the place is madness with live music at the back and a generally good vibe about the place. Jammed with tourists (this is Grassmarket afterall!) Biddys is a good spot to chat to strangers (not pick up strangers mind, just chat) and have a bit of fun. The pint is decent and an OK price, the draft cider tastes good.   Biddys (or Mulligans, if you prefer) has taken a different approach to 'Irish Bar' than say, Malones. The walls are wallpapered with Irish Newspapers and there's Jerseys in frames on the walls.

After 20 minutes of waiting - and having had the tables sprayed and wiped all around us, inhaling cleaning products, urgh - still no menus, waitress, attention or anything. So we left. The other 3 couples who came in and started waiting are probably still there... waiting for a menu. All the best gang, hope you packed a lunch!",

    "text": "Slap bang in the centre of the Grassmarket, if you're heading out for drinks in this neck of the woods then you should definitely stop in here for a few, whether afternoon or evening.  For starters, if you're a student then you can bag yourself a Student Recommended card which gets you drinks from as cheap as 1.50. More importantly, they're drinks you'd actually choose to buy and not just because they're cheap as is usually the way in bars with promos - Magners is only 2.50 and a glass of wine is only 2.25, whilst you can get yourself a Vodka + Mixer for as little as 1.75. What's more, with the outdoor seating area you can take full advantage of the few rare sunny Edinburgh days by enjoying your drinks al fresco.  Lots of people criticise this place, and the majority of the pubs in the Grassmarket along with it, for always being full of stag/hen parties getting rowdier and more annoying by the minute. Yes, it's True that a lot of these groups come here, but this place is more than big enough that you can always find a table out of range of their drinking games. In fact, in my opinion it makes for a much better atmosphere in the place when there are always people up for a good time.   That said, when the beers go to your head then I'd definitely recommend taking advantage of the Soup & Sandwich combo for 4... from personal experience I can say that the fresh crusty bread, heaps of fillings and home-made tangy tomato soup will sort you right out for another few hours of pub-going.  Aside from the tourists, if you're into your sports then this is definitely your place. As far as girls go, I love watching the football in the pub with a few drinks and this place has so many screens up and so many different Sky Sports channels that they're bound to be able to accomodate your requests.",

In the last few years I've barely been in, but I was in again quite recently, and they've done it up a bit. Well it's hard to tell exactly what they've done when it's rammed with people but the toilets have changed. The womens are now where the mens used to be and the mens have moved...elsewhere! One of the doors seemed to be missing off one of the loos in the ladies, but this didn't stop anyone using them...with the help of an obviously good friend standing in front of them! There does seem to be more seating which I guess is a good thing. It's still pretty dark in there though!",

They have live music some nights and decently priced beer. They also have food.  I went there on my birthday also. The friend I was visiting had to get up early the next day, so she left me with two guys I'd never met before. I had a great time with them. One of them met me at my hostel the next morning, and in return for a meal at Biddy's, he showed me around Edinburgh while my friend was in class.  I ate haggis. It didn't kill me. I wouldn't eat it again, but more because it was boring than because it was \"icky\". It tastes like bround lamb with indian spices and oatmeal. So, imagine oatmeal... OK now brown some ground lamb meat... OK now put some cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper in the meat... OK now mix it with the oatmeal!!! HAGGIS! Euan had Nachos, which he pronounced funny because he has an accent. Kind of like he's about to say \"natural\" but then says nachos instead.  And and and... you can buy condoms and vibrators and inflatable sheep in the bathroom. Who doesn't want and/or need an inflatable sheep?",

    "text": "Ok, first to clarify - this review is only for breakfast. I can't speak to other times/meals/drinks.  First off, the good - the food was decent, the server was super nice, and there was plenty of seating on a Sunday morning. And it opens at 8am, so if you have a real early start, ok.  But let's be clear about some other things, too. First, to disagree with another reviewer, it's Irish, not Scottish. No haggis for you! Second, it's attached to a hotel, and has a definite hotel pub vibe to it (Fleetwood Mac playing while older folks drank their morning coffee). Third, there are only like four things on the breakfast menu.  Also, there's a meat pie shop on the other corner at the same intersection that's very good, and opens almost as early.  Anyway, like I said, the food was fine, and it's quite comfortable, so if this is what you want, go for it. But the other reviews were so positive I felt a little bit misled (not the pub's doing, of course, and maybe in the evenings it's fantastic?). Wanted to provide a little balance, since I was not impressed.",

All the drinks are pretty well priced with most pints costing less than 3.  Further, the decor is stylish and makes you feel at home right away with adequately comfortable seating and lots of tables to chill out at. It attracts a good range of customers, from locals to students who all seem friendly and chilled out.  If you're in the area and after a relaxing drink with friends, this is the place.",

However, having been persuaded to go along to Biddy Mulligans for a swift few pints under the promise it wouldnt be as bad as my friend had described, I must admit I have come to like this pub.  Yes, there was the obligatory Stag party - but truth be told, they wernt out of control, and rather added to the atmosphere of a lively and well enjoyed pub.  The drinks were cheap, but after the third round and finding out we could get a student discount card thingy - drinks became even cheaper. HAving been there for a little while, a live band set up who were rather good - if a bit hard to here over the general hubbb of Biddy's.  Food is also available, and is pretty good if standard pub fair and the staff are frindly.  Over all, I have taken a shine to this place, even if i do have to put up with stag/hen parties.",

There was a live band so it was packed and loud (with the audience singing along).  Just what we were looking for!  We ordered the Tennents Lager which is a Scottish brew.  Also wanted a Balvenie whisky but they were out so our friendly bartender recommended Craggeman's-which is also from the Speyside region.  Excellent suggestion!  The live band wasn't playing for long after we arrived so they must have started earlier.  We shut the place down at 1.  Definitely a fun place for drinks with a great vibe.",

They must have traveled to a garden and picked the green peppers and sliced them very slowly and carefully. The place was not busy. What a strange experience.",

    "text": "In my opinion, this place was just okay. But, if you were to ask my husband, he'd tell you that it was good. Guess we won't agree on this one.  We needed something to eat after kind of a hectic first day in Edinburgh, and their menu called to us the most. The place wasn't very packed when we got in, so we snagged a small table in the back and took our time checking out the food offerings.  In the end, I went with the Irish stew (in a Scottish restaurant, go figure), and my husband got the Steak and Ale pie. We supplemented our orders with a beer for him and a cider for me.  It didn't take long for the food to come out, but when it did, I was kind of disappointed. The stew was more soup-like in consistency; it could have used a nice slurry to thicken it up a bit. And also, it was loaded with carrots and potatoes - all well and good, but it was meat I was hunting for (and not really finding). And finally, it was kind of bland. I had to add a bit of salt to give it some pep - and I never use salt on anything.  My husband loved his pie - meat and flaky crust served with fries and peas. At least, he had no complaints then, and still seems to enjoy the memory of the meal now.  Service wasn't spectacular, though they didn't outright forget about us, which is a bonus. The waiter was indifferent and mostly vacant, which made it hard for us to pay our bill when we were ready to leave.   So, yeah - not the best dining experience ever, but not the worst, either.",

There were items I couldn't decide between, but I settled on the chicken ceasar salad and prosecco! It came out in rapid time, and the staff was VERY friendly!  I wish I had sat outside on their patio because it's a great view of the surrounding businesses, and you can people watch!  I ended up eating here three times actually. It was extremly convenient since I was staying at The Grassmarket Hotel, and they can bring your dinner to your room, WOO HOO!  The fish and chips were GOOD! The fries are pretty basic, but it came with a salad which was nice!   The macaroni and cheese was not up to my pro standards :( I ate some of it, but it needed a creamier sauce, just an FYI! It also came with fries, a salad, and garlic bread which was much more than I was expecting! I was starving so I was happy ;)   Overall, this place is worth stopping in for food! When I came down to order dinner on my last night, the place was PACKED! Clearly it's well liked!   I highly recommend coming here and getting food if your room isn't ready as well, they had free wifi (or from the hotel, I don't remember which, but I had wifi) and it was nice to just sit and have a drink!",

Also had the lamb stew, the lamb was well over cooked and the dish was just meat chunks and some potatoes with salt and maybe onion powder. Reminded me of bad beef stew. I hold lamb stew close to my heart as far as dishes go so when it's not good I am very let down. Seems like a nice place to sit at the bar and have a pint though. If you want better service and a smaller environment try the royal McGregor",
