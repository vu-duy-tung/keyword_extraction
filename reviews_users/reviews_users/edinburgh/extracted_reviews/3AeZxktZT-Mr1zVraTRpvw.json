I Travel a lot, and don't normally see such an extensive menu in a hotel.  Having said that, I was just in it for the peppermint tea tonight. Our server was quick and polite. He brought everything out on a tray with our own little teapot. Swing by to relax after enjoying Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I'm a Marriott loyalist. This has to be one of the worst dinning experiences I've ever had at a Marriott propriety. I flew in from LA extremely tired so decided to eat at the hotel restaurant. The service was horribly slow and the restaurant wasn't that busy. I ordered the chowder to start and a ribeye as the main. The chowder was bland, no seafood at all, salt and pepper helped. As for the steak... I ordered the $24 ribeye medium. Their first attempt came out and it honestly looked like someone's left overs. I was afraid if I ate it I would get sick. I sent it back and to my surprise a decent steak appeared in about a 1/3 the time of the first order.  This place is good for a drink but do not eat here. Hotel is that great either. Stay next door at the Glasshouse. Won't be back.",

    "text": "Inside the new Courtyard in Edinburgh on Baxter's Pl near Waverly Station, this is a bar and restaurant that is open to the public but mainly caters to guests. We dropped in for a nightcap during our stay at the Courtyard. Since the whole building is brand new, there was still some spray plain and glue smells around the bar. The tap beer selection was not half-bad with about 4 Scottish beers to choose from. We sampled a few, but they were not tasting great.  Tap beers were poured into clean glassware with ample, 1liter mug pours. They also had a surprising amount of bottled beer as well. The Scotch selection was impressive for this venue - served in proper, upscale glassware. Our bartender was friendly throughout the evening. There's a restaurant attached but we didn't eat there.   This was a pretty clutch find as they were open for drinks until midnight on a Sunday.",
