    "text": "I've walked past Crepe Array daily for the last month and a half, and finally decided to try their crepes about two weeks ago. It's conveniently right outside the St James Shopping centre, and with a cute outdoor sitting area, it's not a bad idea to head there when the weather is good (or passable).   After agonizing over the menu for an annoying ten minutes (annoying for the staff I bet) I decided to have the New Yorker, which is a bacon,cheese and maple syrup crepe. In retrospect, I believe I could have chosen better, as there were delicious-looking cheese, mushroom and ham crepes for example. No crepe will ever taste as good as this underground crepe grotto I found in Aix en Provence (yes, Franceeeee) but it wasn't shabby at all. Expect to spend just under 4 for a good crepe!",

    "text": "The idea of a 'pancake to go' is a great idea especially when you can find flavour offerings such as banana and Nutella on the menu. Prices seem to be fully aware of the novelty (at around 3) but nonetheless the potential is there for a tasty treat.  My encounter of the stall outside the St James Centre consisted of a literally half-asleep (his head was flat on the counter when I approached the stall) snotty nosed teenager labouring over concocting my pancake. This dampened my spirits on what was a pretty decent offering.",
