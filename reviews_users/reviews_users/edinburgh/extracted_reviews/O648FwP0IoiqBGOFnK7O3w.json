    "text": "I got a takeaway from here 7/5/10. The owner/chef took my order and was arrogant in his manner of talking.   After my order of Chicken, ginger and spring onion along with beef with mushroom and oyster sauce arrived, I decided to put it out on a plate. To my amazement I saw tiny little bits of cubed chicken (think it was chicken) with the spring onion. It tasted ok but was so minut. I then put out my beef and to my amazment there was hardly anything there apart fae veg and tiny slithers of meat. It tasted disgusting and I was so disgusted I phoned them up to complain.   Chicken I wanted. not tiny minut cubes of frozen chick you could buy out of iceland!   Anyway I was fobbed off by a girl on the phone so asked to speak to the man himself. Told him the problem to which he just listened and never said a word apart from a mutter, even though I'd asked him to comment on it he just hummed and hawed until I said i wanted a refund. He shouted down the phone \"NO refund you\" and hung up!   This is a shocking display of a businessman who doesn't give 2 flying hoots for his customers... tiny little bits of cubed chicken isn't a chinese meal to me nor is lots of veg that replaces meat.   I'm complaining to trading standards about this business and would not recommend this place to anyone. He also got part of my order wrong and charges a blooming fortune!   1 unhappy customer who will never buy again!!!!!!!!!!!",
