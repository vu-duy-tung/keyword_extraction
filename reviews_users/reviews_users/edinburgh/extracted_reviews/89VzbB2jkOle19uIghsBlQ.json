    "text": "Love this quirky new bar in Newington! I came by for wifi and a cuppa and ended up hanging out for longer than expected... Needless to say the drink got upgraded to a cocktail ludicrously quickly. Well with their Pocket Friendly Cocktail menu who can blame me? 3.50 for a raspberry gin mojito?! YES PLEASE!!  With a very stylish interior, this place has a lovely atmosphere and nice staff. The food and drink prices are pretty good, but beware - this place is super busy so if you wan eat, book in advance to avoid disappointment.  I love that they're dog friendly and they have a soup n sandwich offer for only 5 through the week. Defo worth checking out if you're in the area :)  Cheers!!",

    "text": "They have a 50% off your bill special if you book a table online before the 20th of March.  Dropped in for the 5 lunch special. Soup and a sandwich. The soup was a carrot and sweet potato, and the sandwich was salmon with watercress pesto. Both very good. Once you factor buying a drink in it actually came to6.50 , but that was still a pretty good deal.  It's just opened, and service was a little slow, I'm going to put that down to a new restaurant working out the kinks. Well worth checking out.",

Doesn't charge over the odds for crisps (Kettle) which is good.  Staff friendly and service was ok. Bit awkward when I came in as I had limited seating options it appeared, despite loads of empty tables away from the front door.  So, ok, would pop in for a drink if in the area meeting friends.",

    "text": "It may not be the most accurate to write a review of Southpour as I actually didn't consume anything here.  We visited today, intending to have a drink.   From the outside the refurb looks decent if generic but from the inside it feels soulless. Geared toward table service, we were treated oddly when we went up to the (tiny) bar to check out the beer selection- which turned out to be shockingly poor.   Between the cold atmosphere and the non existent beer selection, we decided to leave. Big fans of Reverie, Southpour appears to be a big loss for the area. What a disappointment.",

The salad we ordered came with salmon.we ordered chicken. The salad which was served afterwards was with wrong ingredients and was really not tasty. We got 25% off for bad service....but our evening was bumped.",

(There was an initial booking issue as this can't be done online, but they do take bookings by phone if you speak to them directly.)  The food is reasonably priced and varied, including some vegetarian options. The staff were very accommodating for me as a pregnant lady and now lady with a pram, even though table space is tight, so not ideal multiple prams at once. - My only reluctance of giving 5* is that I don't want it to become so popular that I can't get a table myself. :)",
