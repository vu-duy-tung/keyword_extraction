    "text": "I've been a Tempo Tea Bar lover since day 1 and I am so excited to see them to expand into Edinburgh! I feel like Tempo are the leaders of the pack in the bubble tea scene and they always get the fun, frivolous, fabulous vibe just right in their Glasgow stores - but how would Edinburgh compare?   Well, as soon as I walked in I got a super cheery, warm welcome. The space is cool - in an arch and there's the right signage you expect from Tempo. I got my usual apple bubble tea with some strawberry jelly and was really chuffed with it. Delicious. Friendly staff, delicious drinks and something to brighten up my afternoon - perfection!  Notes: Well worth taking a detour from Waverley station to swing by for a bubble tea as it's only about 5 minutes away.",

However, drinking bubble tea is sort of like tasting wine! It is subjective and everyone has their own opinion about it.   I was here for the yelp preview event and got a chance to sample 5 different types of bubble teas. As I am not a big fan of fruit tea, it is a no brainer taro&vanilla milk tea was the winner!   Tip: Customise your drinks....Would you like: Less sweet?  A stronger tea flavour? To add on another flavour like melon, peach, and even chcoolate? You are allowed to taste your own creation here (~_^) so enjoy it how you like it",

Ok, I know that sounds super random, but bare with me. This Is not the easiest beverage to describe I must admit, but whatever flavour combinations you choose I guarantee you with discover happiness in a glass!   Tempo Tea have a great little shop in those quirky arches just along the road from Waverley Station. It has a really awesome interior with bubble lights and iPads on the wall (to do selfies on!!), and there is a great playful vibe to match. Super trendy!  I'm really happy to hear they support local artists and musicians by getting them to design tee shirts and bags for them and stock their CDs in store. It really doesn't feel like Edinburgh when you come here, it's its own bubble of joy and a great spot to head to when you need cheering up and a change of scene.   Although seating is limited inside, this is the perfect place to grab a drink on the go. They have an epic selection of teas, juices and milk drinks to choose from, alongside a lot of different flavoured bubbles, boba and jellies to add to the base. (If you're confused by that last part, essentially I'm saying juicy balls, chewy balls, and Aloe Vera/coconut jelly pieces. They are a taste sensation, promise!!). You can have your drink hot, cold, or iced, caffeinated or caffeine free, and don't even get me started in the vast arrays of tasty juice and flavour combos you can have!   I am extremely excited by this place as the possibilities are so endless and they really are very specialist in what they do. Take note that there are not any other bubble tea places in Edinburgh as diverse and fun as this one! Prices are really reasons for what they do, but be prepared to start a bubble tea kitty fund, because you're going to get addicted fast!!  Top tip: The watermelon tea with Apple bubbles is super refreshing and tastes like summer and the Tarro Milk Tea with coconut jellies is like drinking a cake! There is literally something for every occasion... Keep your eye out for the star shaped boba too, its ludicrously cute!!",

So it's kinda like a fruit tea (can have cold or hot) you can pick your syrup flavours, the tea base  (green, chamomile etc) and the different types of 'bubbles' - no it's not fizzy... the bubbles are little jelly like things in the bottom of your tea... sounds weird but it's kinda cool - some are star shaped, others made from Aloe Vera (healthy!) and there's even popping bubbles - these are my favourites - their like miniature grapes which burst in your mouth oozing with fruity flavour! - all in all a tasty, refreshing, kinda healthy and cool drink experience!  The cafe is a great addition to the upcoming East market Street vault businesses, staff are friendly, helpful and really passionate and enthusiastic about their product - you can tailor make your own drink to have it just the way you like it and there are both hot and cold teas available - hoping they may even get a licence as the flavours would be fab with a little alcohol twist - but if they don't you can buy the bubbles or ingredients to make your own concoctions at home!  These guys also support local artists and musicians so whilst you are slurping your tea you can browse some music and merchandise from up n' coming artists.  I'll def. be back - can see this being a great place to grab a cold, refreshing drink in the sunshine this summer (if we get some!!)",

Tempo Tea Bar provides a modern twist to the ever growing and delicious bubble tea scene. They boast fruity and colorful flavors galore topped with tons of sweetness. Also hint hint you can combine any and as many flavors you want. The limit is just the number of pumps of delicious syrup that will fit in your glass.   So, are you also looking for a new artist or some local artistic flavor? Tempo Tea Bar hosts art and music from local up and coming artists. So you'll be ahead of the crowd ;)   Also they have slushy versions of their drinks. Yum! Perfect for a hot day or whenever you're feeling for something icy. But if you want hot, not a problem either. Or maybe you're not into sweet not a problem just let them know. Maybe you just want the pearls or jelly, not a problem only about 5 for a cup full.",

    "text": "I wish I could just put a little love heart because that really would suffice.   Tempo is fun, bright and sweet, offering delicious milk and fruit bubble teas with popping boba and fruity jelly toppings. I was a little bit in love with Tempo in Glasgow so, just thinking of the addition of this epic tea bar in Edinburgh made me smile.   If you haven't had bubble tea before, I recommend that you head on down to the Waverley Arches. The Tempo team are cheery and upbeat; the shop warm and uplifting; and the tea itself just lovely. The drinks are customisable and the menu is clear and simple. The prices are reasonable and there's also a decent selection of snacks available in the shop.  When I'm in a new city, I often seek out a bubble tea place. I've found that certain places tend to be churning out artificial, sickly sweet drinks and I find myself disappointed. Tempo makes the best and most natural tasting bubble tea that I've tried. I always look forward to visiting and ordering a milk tea. - Make mine forever a strawberry and vanilla milk tea with strawberry popping boba!  Welcome to Edinburgh, Tempo! - I hope this city's as good to you as Glasgow has been. You'll find this girl at the Waverley Arches a little more frequently; bubble tea in hand!",

Found under Jeffrey Street, this new development is opening these old 1875 c-listed arches (formerly used for storage) to the public. Reimagining them to house boutique shops, cafes and art venues.   Tempo Tea Bar, founded by May Gem Tan and her brother is a trendy bar catering for adults and children alike. The fun bubble tea drinks come in a multitude of flavours, milk based and juice based. The 'bubbles' also come in many varieties from popping lychee 'boba' bubbles, mango jelly stars, aloe vera pieces to chewy tapioca balls to add fun and flavour.   We got the chance to sample 5 of these flavours last night at the pre-launch yelp event. My favourite was definitely the new spring special 'Zestea Passion' - an ice blend on a base of Jasmine tea, flavoured with Orange and Passion fruit, ad filled with Mango Jelly Stars.",

This is a great starting point, they break the menu up so its easy to know what to order: choose a flavour ( fruit flavour pumps  -well theres a lot of choices so maybe not that easy) , chose a tea base ( black, green, white, red), choose a fruit tea to mix, and then chose a \"topping\" ( which is a strange they call it that because it's really a \"bottom\" add ) , You can do half popping bubbles, half jellies, or just one if you want. I also really love the traditional boba, but if your new to bubble tea then I'd recommend starting with the popping bubbles. Endless mixes and matched! You can get the drink cold, hot or slushed ( blended ice).  If its all still too much they staff have made some mixed choices up, ask them they are super friendly!   Tempo Tea Bar started in Glasgow and we are so luckily that they have opened one in Edinburgh now! A hip spin on the traditional bubble tea, Tempo does lots of fruity mixes and has a large choice of popping juice bubbles.  I love this location as its super close to the train station and in the cool old arches.  p.s. They also support local musical artists! Which I think is cool",

    "text": "If like me you were unfamiliar with the concept bubble tea then let me attempt to explain what Tempo tea bar is about. A little yet sweet new shop just openned it's door to Edinburgh after successfully launching their first one in Glasgow. It is a family run business, where a brother and sister make us relive their childhood treat... Bubble tea. It consists of brewing tea (assam, camomile,insert here type of tea you want), it can be cold or warm btw and then mixed with added fruit sirops to add it's sweetness (apple, strawberry, passion fruit, the list is long you name it). Finally they add their piece de resistance: tapioca balls or what they call 'boba' which add all the magic to the drink. Using a straw you have a drink which added sweet balls of bursting flavours. Sorry it's hard to explain! All I can say is that it is totally worth trying if you haven't done before.  I personally loved the fruity tea I sampled, though wasn't a big fan of the coconut milky ones nor would choose again the jelly boba type as they were quite akward to drink. That being said they have so much other choices that everyone should be able to find something suitable for their palate.",

Although there aren't many options, Tempo Tea Bar is more than enough to satisfy any boba cravings. I like how all drinks are so customizable and they even let you do half of one topping and half of another without an extra charge! I tried a few of their fruity combinations (both cold and ice blended) and everything I tried was superb (given that it's Scotland - the boba scene here is obviously nonexistent). The shop itself is a bit small but it's a cozy and fun place to chat with a friend. Definitely give this place a try!",
