    "text": "Shocked I haven't reviewed this place yet as I eat here almost every day.  The coffee is a proper Italian one to get you going which exactly what I need in the morning.  The best things in here though are a toasted flatbread called a piadine which is just great and I have never had one anywhere else.  The inter-piadine (after inter Milan) is my husbands and sons  favourite.  It's perfect according to them but I am pretty keen on the pancetta scone (Italian Parma ham toasted between two tattie scones) which is slightly mind blowingly yummy. I sometimes have them add herbed halved cherry tomatoes to it.  Boom!",

    "text": "Mama Mia! This little italian is hidden away on a side street in Stockbridge. Blink and you miss it, but please don't blink too long as missing it will be such a shame.  Go on a sunny day, you can sit outside and enjoy some of the finest italian coffee this side of Italy. Strong baby strong! There's some arty magazines and the usual newspapers to read, so you won't be bored if you forget your book or your friends.  They also do a range of paninis using italian ingredients so you've got an authentic  experience from the get go. Heck even the owners speak italian to one another.  Size wise the cafe is pretty small, so you might struggle to find a seat on say a Saturday but it's well worth visiting even then, as you can grab a take away to enjoy your grub around the corner by the water of leith.  In short it's a great stop when you've visited the shops in Stockbridge and you're feeling slightly peckish or you're running low on caffeine.",
