    "text": "Good enough for us to come back on another trip to Edinburgh, so I think this place has our attention.  Six degrees North has a great beer selection and a nice sub selection of sours.  One thing we like about this place is that we typically see beers from other parts of the world (on tap) that are exotic to us and very attractive to try.  The bartender we had (wish we could remember her name) was very friendly and very helpful when it came time to trying out beers. We appreciate that.  All of the beers were reasonably priced, and could also be ordered in smaller than pint sizes.  The bar seating is nice to be able to view all of the beers on the video screen and chat with the bartender. Plenty of other seating is available, comfortable, clean atmosphere and we'd definitely come back on a future trip.",

    "text": "This place had a huge beer selection. They had just about every kind of beer possible, except for my favorite which is a Double IPA. The staff were friendly. You have to order at the bar. There were not servers taking orders while we were there. They have bar snacks, & they were not serving regular food while we were there. Overall, I thought this place was interesting. I wasn't a fan of most of the beer I drank while in the UK, but they had a decent selection here.",

    "text": "This is a nice laid back little pub. At least the time that I was here. My friends and I arrived here on a Sunday evening. We grabbed a few beers and some dinner. They have a large selection of brews that are well laid out on the monitor you can see in the photos. The staff was friendly and punctual. I ordered the Angus Burger and some chips/fries, while my friends ordered a plate of garlic bread for everyone. The burger was great, thick juicy, and pretty standard ingredients that you would get anywhere really. The garlic bread is what really stood out to me. The decor seemed to be real classy and created a very mellow vibe. The booth seating was quite comfortable and sizable. Overall I would defiantly go back here on a busy day or not.",

At the best part of a fiver a pint you may though want to remortgage before you pop in for a serious session.",

Extensive list of beers, I think predominately Belgian but not all are as Scottish/UK beers also on tap.   I've come here for the gluten free beers which are around 4.90 a bottle and there are around 2-3 options in bottle form. Nothing on draft which would be a win for me.  So, not bad for beers and if you are gf then you are not left out. Worth a visit!",

    "text": "As a fan of beer generally, and Belgian beer specifically, I was excited to hear that Six Degrees North were opening an Edinburgh branch last month. My boyfriend and I went along last night for delicious beer and a bite to eat, and we weren't disappointed.  The interior reminded us of some pubs in Brussels we're fans of, and the beer selection is top notch. There are many, many taps (handily displayed on screens above the bar) featuring their own beer, collaborations, some Belgian classics and other beers from elsewhere in the British isles. And just wait until you see the bottles menu! Oh my goodness, it is thorough, I'd take a guess at there being maybe 150 offerings? Seriously, it's immense.  The staff were friendly and helpful, more than willing to let you sample several beers before making your mind up, and able to give learned recommendations. The only niggle would be that whilst the taps look really cool, the big ol' metal tube is right at eyeline and blocks your view of the bar somewhat.  We decided to grab something to eat, and it's a good menu of lots of different plates, most available in small and large sizes. We shared smalls of chicken live pate (dreamy) and three cheese croquettes (so good) and then had mains of carbonnade (a traditional Flemish beef stew, very good) and beer battered haddock goujons with chips and mushy peas (excellent, but a huge portion and I had to leave quite a bit).  The menus could do with a bit of smartening up, I get that it's cheap to print on normal paper and replace when they get manky, but it's out of place with an otherwise fairly smart bar and I'd personally be printing them on a higher weight and better quality coated paper, it'd just look and feel much nicer. There's also mention of their Stonehaven, Aberdeen and Glasgow bars in the menu but not Edinburgh, so it needs a refresher anyway.  That's really minor though, and on what counts (the beer, the food and the service) we were really impressed. I foresee many visits in the future.",

    "text": "It was great to discover that Six Degrees North have established an outpost in Edinburgh!  Being a big fan of the original bar in Aberdeen I had high expectations of my visit.  Pleased to   say I was not disappointed! The beer selection was impressive, as was the staff's knowledge of them.  Along with great recommendations, the staff also provided tastings.    Was delighted that the bar has the same relaxed atmosphere as I had enjoyed in Aberdeen.  Although there is music in the bar it was not intrusive.  The bar menu is relatively limited, but the food was very tasty and the portions generous.  The burger was really juicy and full of flavour.  Perhaps didn't need quite so many chips!",

    "text": "a Mecca for Belgian beer aficionados. Main things first: extensive selection on draft (20 taps?) - focused on 6DN's own beer - and a pretty unrivalled selection of Belgian bottled beers.  What's not to like?  There is a decent menu with snacks through to full meal options. I had garlic bread, which was a huge portion of some of the best GB I have ever tasted, followed by a cheeseburger, which was a little disappointing (wish I had chosen the more trad Belgian options - stews etc).  Big downside for me is the decor and design - i was there at lunchtime and I found the place a bit dark and dingy.  Maybe brightens up in the evening?  Also the seating is a really disappointing angular formica style set up, with booths and high tables.  I really didn't find it comfortable, which for a place selling STRONG beer is an issue.  I want to feel cosy.  Still, great beer and good service are the main reasons to recommend this excellent bar.",
