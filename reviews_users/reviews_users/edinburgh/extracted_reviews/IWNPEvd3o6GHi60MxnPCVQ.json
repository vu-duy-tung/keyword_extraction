But when it comes to food, you would find that it is just out of this world, everything is just well cooked and well presented with dishes similar to the usual middle eastern menu but with a hint and under Kurdish names.  I might have not emphasised on this enough. but, simply Put, this is one of the best you might get in Edinburgh.",

Tender, delicious, beautifully cooked pieces of chicken, lamb and minced-lamb kofta.   But other people had a variety of underwhelming mushy stews, and my vegan friend said hers tasted like .... a bowl of spinach. \"It's like they made the recipe for lamb and spinach and just left out the lamb without adding any other flavour\".  I'd agree with Lou, below, about the felafel, too - you could use them as weapons. The stuffed vine leaves head in the opposite direction, being too soft and floppy.   So - if you want a delicious feast of meat, this is great. If not, maybe not ideal.",

    "text": "Okay, I'm very divided about this review.  First of all, let me say that the service was absolutely top-notch. Very friendly staff and lovely ambiance. And because of that I really, really, really, wanted to give this place more than one star,  but in all honesty, I can't.  Here's what happened last night: I was with a group of friends and I ordered a starter as a main (I tend to eat smaller portions). While the rest of my friends seemed rather happy with their choices, one was very happy the rest meh-ish happy, I received three falafel balls on shredded lettuce with a small cup of humus.  It was so disappointing, I don't even know where to start. The falafel were deep fried for so long that they were clearly burned on the outside, dark-dark brown almost blackened. There was no moisture, none, left in them. The shell of the falafel, what should have been a thin crispy crust, had turned into a half an inch thick uncrackable concrete-like substance. I had to hack away at it (really) with my knife to get at the inside, which was dry and tasted like sawdust with a tiny hint of chickpea.  AND because I didn't want to ruin my friends birthday by complaining about my food, I ate it like a good little girl and suffered a massive stomach ache for the rest of the evening. No wonder, those balls were so hard they would have shattered like glass had I thrown them on the floor. And that's also what they felt like in my stomach, shards of glass.  Now, the rest of the group was -let me reiterate- okay with their choices. No matter that the bread that came with it was kinda bland and the humus was ... well,... meh.   Maybe I should give this place another chance, but I really don't want to suffer through another brick-induced 6-hour stomach ache again. This was a horrible experience.",

I'd been trying to visit Hanam's for months, but whenever I turned up every table would be taken by happy diners. Eventually I managed to get a table (in the festival no less) and I was not disappointed. Good service, good food, and good wine (of course! I chose it myself in the wine store as Hanam's is BYOB. Very helpful for the bottom line).   My other half and I both ordered lamb dishes, and they were absolutely delicious. The big naan breads we got went down well too. I've noticed in Edinburgh's Middle Eastern restaurants the naan's are far less stodgy than those found in Indian restaurants.  The humus was a bit strange, and tasted quite shop bought. But apart from that Hanam's is pretty good for a munch.",

    "text": "We walked to Hanam's near the castle from our rental apartment.  It was pretty unassuming and even though it was early, the tables were beginning to fill up and it smelled pretty darn good. We were greeted immediately and, with our party of six, they quickly put some tables together for us.   FYI...I'm going to get some of the dish names wrong here so I apologize in advance. And, yes, it was a bummer that they don't serve alcohol but I respect that and took the opportunity to have some juice instead (hmmmm....would've been good with some vodka in it ;-)  We started with the dip trio with naan. Came with baba ganoush, hummus and a yogurt / cucumber sauce and it hit the spot....dips were very good overall with the baba ganoush being the slight weak link and the hummus the standout favorite. Naan was very good as well.  The kids loved the chicken kebabs and this is a rarity as they usually dont like any spice at all. Other folks in my party had lamb (reported as very good and nicely spiced), chicken kebabs, and another vegetarian dish. I had the Tapsi which was a vegetarian stew. Very savory and excellent flavor with eggplant and cauliflower in a tomato and olive oil-based sauce.  It was served with a white long-grain rice....maybe jasmine or saffron? They also passed out a chili sauce and a yogurt-based sauce that I think were supposed to be for the kebabs but I \"borrowed\" some for my dish and it was delish.   All in all a pretty good experience. As an Edinburgh visitor, it would probably make my go-back-to list if I were in the immediate area. If I were a local, I would do a little more searching and I'm guessing it might still be on my top list of Mediterranean places.",

    "text": "I love Middle Eastern food so was excited when I heard there was a Kurdish/Middle Eastern restaurant in Edinburgh that I had yet to try!  My boyfriend booked us a table at Hanams for Valentine's day so I was thrilled to give it a try. The restaurant itself is very neat and tidy with a cozy, Middle Eastern-themed (go figure!) atmosphere. There are lovely large wooden tables, cushions on the bench seating, flowing curtains and traditional lighting.  The smell inside is also amazing as it smells like barbeque and/or grilled meat!  There are a variety of dishes on the menu and prices are fairly reasonable.  It should be mentioned that it is BYOB but they do have a selection of soft drinks, juices, teas and coffees. We shared a starter of three dips (hummus, babaganoush and a yogurt/tzaziki style dip) with a large piece of naan bread.  It was quite tasty (the hummus was our personal favourite) but we felt we could have had a bit more naan bread with it. However, we had plenty of dips left over which we kept for our main course so it all depends on how you look at it I guess!  For our mains, my partner had a lamb gosht, which consisted of tender lamb pieces, potatoes and carrots stewed in a lovely tomato-based sauce. This was served with a generous bowl of basmati rice, which was nicely flavoured with cloves and various spices.  I had a chicken wing/chickpea curry type dish which was also served with a large bowl of rice. We then got another piece of naan with it to share.  Both main dishes were delicious and we were quite pleased with the flavours and the size of the portion.  For dessert we shared Persian saffron and cardamom ice cream, which was lovely! At first I thought the flavour would be overpowering but it had a nice aromatic flavour.  It's hard to describe but it was definitely worthy trying!  I had the mango juice to drink, which was quite nice and my partner had the chai tea.    Overall we were pleased with our meal. We enjoyed the atmosphere and we felt the prices were fairly reasonable for being in a touristy area. Our bill totalled roughly 40 pounds for both of us, which for three courses (albeit two were shared between us) and drinks was not too bad.  Some things could be a bit cheaper, for instance, the starter was almost 8 pounds for one piece of naan and 3 small ramekins filled with dip, but as a whole it was affordable for a Valentine's night out.  There are also set meals for 2 which I think total about 35 pounds and include three courses. The couple beside us had that and it looked like they had a great selection of things to share between them. I think I would get that next time I went!  My only complaint, although not enough to put me off going there again, was the service was a bit lack-luster.  While the staff were fairly friendly, I felt they were not as attentive as they could have been. We were seated before a few tables yet were served after them.  We also had to wait quite awhile to flag down anyone for our bill.  Overall though, these complaints are minor and the restaurant is definitely a good place to go if you are interested in trying this type of cuisine or already love it!",

    "text": "Hanam's, a Kurdish restaurant, is conveniently located across the street from the Hub, and just down from the castle and at the top of the Royal Mile.  The proprietor meets you at the door with a smile. Hanam's has a friendly feel. With its bright white tablecloths, the whole place feels clean and fresh (the toilets were notably clean too!)  The menu offers lots choice- including vegetarian. Within each section (starters, mains etc.) the dishes are interesting and exotic (to the likes of me at least). It's something different from the ubiquitous usual Indian or Chinese. All the dishes come with rise and Kurdish naan.  I went with two friend and we shared three dishes. one sweet dish with apricots, one based around okra and one spicier aubergine dish. There could have perhaps been a little more flavour in the latter two but they were still delicious. Between this and the rice it was surprisingly filling. For the sake of this review I thought we should sample the very tempting dessert menu. We settled for the sharing platter for two (which was actually fine for three) which included various little sample sweets like baklava and ice cream.  As an other reviewer has pointed out, Hanam's does not serve alcohol. Presumably this is because it is Muslim restaurant, so I think we can look past that. They do however offer many alcohol free drinks including a traditional yogurt drink, which although I didn't particularly like, am glad I tried.  Hanam's is highly recommended.",

This doesn't really ever define our dining experience except this was a celebratory meal of rather gruesome exam period.  Too ashamed to get up and leave we proceeded to order. Our food came and to be frank with you it left me feeling very indifferent. Despite the exotic feel to the shop, the food was rather bland and well uninteresting despite their names. Food from this area is usually rich with spices but it felt like they forgot half the spices and gave us a bland variety which I guess the great British public would consider exotic but for us (mostly international students from areas close to that region) left us feeling a bit cheated. We also wanted to smoke a (rather overpriced) sisha pipe but were told we couldn't cause it was too early in the day (?).  Having said that the service was really efficient and friendly. The view from the windows is grand as you look down on Old Town rooftops.  I hope this was a one-off experience and their cuisine has improved a bit since then. Some friends of mine who went (not those who were with me) said they really enjoyed their meal. I hope to come here again... watch this space.",

The meals are not particularly cheap and not particularly special; my main course was basically a chicken kebab with salad, and cost around 9.50. The food was more like a higher quality version of a kebab shop, and though it was enjoyable it was hard to see why you would go there for a sit-down meal. Outside however, you can sit on Victoria Terrace above Edinburgh's Grassmarket and rent out a Shisha; there are a variety of flavours, the staff will keep them working and they even provide blankets if it gets cold. Hanam's do not serve alcohol, however they are happy for you to pop up to the Castle Rock pub, which is a couple of doors down, if you cannot last a whole Shisha without a boozy drink. So if you're looking for somewhere to relax and watch the world go by, but you're not hungry, Hanam's is a great option.",

    "text": "Ah it were a February Wednesday night and Lucie suggested going for some nice Middle Eastern cuisine. She has been going on about us going here for ages but finally last night we made it.  The first thing that hits you when you go in is the smell, strong wafts of BBQ'd  meat.....I knew this was a carnivores restaurant already - this makes me happy. The restaurant itself it really nicely decorated - lots dark reds and Kurdish/Turkish frunishings. The friendly staff quickly make you feel at home and are fast to help you get your BYOB wine open - with no corkage charge to be seen which is a credit to them.  For starter we had the Mushakal sharing starter, this was a delightful selection of the houses favourite starters, complete with hummus and a fresh side salad. My favourite was the Dolma, marinated vine leaves stuffed with aromatic rice.  After considering the mains very carefully we both opted for the Mushakal Kebab, a generous helping of 3 skewers of minced lamb, chicken breast and lamb fillet. The star of the show for me was the lamb mince. It had so much fklavour going on. Wrapped up in some of the plentiful naan with some garlic sauce it was delciious. The chicken was juicy and tender with a light marinade, the lamb fillet was little bit too charred and being fillet had gone a bit tough being overcooked. The flavour though was very nice.  Overall I liked Hanams, I would come back very happily and enjoy some more of their Middle Eastern delights.",

The decor transports you to the Middle East the moment you walk in. Staff are polite and pleasant. There's a seating area upstairs and downstairs. It's a spacious restaurant which also has a balcony for the summer months where you can have shisha. The food is always of great consistent quality and it never disappoints. I find it very difficult finding Middle Eastern food that I like and approve and this is the only one I always visit in Edinburgh.   Recommended starters: hummus, fatoush, baba ghanoush, cheese borek, halloumi, soujuk, mixed dolma. Love the freshly cooked warm naan. My personal fave main is the baly merishke kebab (grilled chicken wings hmmm).  The baklawa is average, sometimes sweet and crunchy, sometimes soggy. Wouldn't go here for dessert. Nevertheless. It's one of my favourite places to eat in Edinburgh.  Overall, love the place, highly recommended.",

We were a group of 8 and they were happy to accommodate.   Everyone enjoyed their meals. I ordered a falafel wrap with halloumi added but was served the wrap and a halloumi starter. The wrap was flavourful and had a good array of spices. The filling was well distributed and I left full. The only slight gripe I had was that the halloumi was charged as a separate starter at 5.50 which I felt was steep for 3 small pieces.",

The service was a bit slow but in a way it was nice to be left alone when in a large group to pour your own wine. The quality and quantity of the food was top notch. Particular mention to the falafels! Yum. We did a complete school boy error though and chose 7 different starters to share amongst the 7 of us. By the time the mains arrived, along with an abundance of rice and bread (no stingy portions to be seen), we were all far too stuffed and our stomachs had to kick into greed mode.    The BYOB facility the main selling factor for me in choosing a dinner venue for a larger group however it's also worth noting it's an ideal venue where you have a token vegetarian or vegan in your group!  I am looking forward to trying it's sister restaurant - Pomegranate.",

Situated just off the Royal Mile, Hanam's is right behind the castle and so it is in an ideal location for all the tourists to reach.

Their menu offers a huge choice of authentic Middle Eastern cuisine, including hummus, falafel, baba ghanoush, shawarma and shish kebabs. I have been here several times for lunch and I absolutely love the place. I completely adore their vegetarian kebab, where the vegetables are marinated in the most amazing tomato sauce that was full of fresh spices - yummy! Their wee balls of falafel are also amazing, tasting really fresh and it comes with hummus which is freshly made. The prices are pretty reasonable, with starters and side dishes costing about 5 and main courses priced at around 10.   The staff at Hanam's were super friendly and welcoming.

Great combination of meat and vegetarian dishes. Lot's of small plate options which allow you to sample and share a wide variety of menu choices. Some our favorites were the lamb with spinach, the marinated grape leaves and the Kurdish chicken. Also try the vegetable casserole, it is phenomenal.  I also have to give a huge shout out to the naan. It has to be the best naan I have ever tasted. Light, flaky and a little crispy.  It was such a beautiful night when we ate at Hanam's we enjoyed the outdoor back terrace overlooking Victoria Street. It didn't have the sumptuous ambiance of the indoor dining rooms, but very enjoyable. Lastly, our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful in navigating the menu.",

The food was flavorful, nicely seasoned: just delicious.  So why only three stars you ask.  Service or lack thereof! The quickest way to kill quality food coming out of the kitchen is by providing bad, bad, bad service.  It was not very busy, but the wait staff was perhaps on a go-slow routine.

Then the female server came and forced us to order food to which we were surprised.  Terrible!    As pretty new to Edinburgh we didn't realize it was the same restaurant.

The naan was hot and flaky, the lamb was tender, the hummus was flavorful, and the tea was strong and aromatic (though I needed a dollop of milk for mine which our charming server was happy to provide). Highly recommend this lovely place.",

We had the trio dipping for an app and that was great too and so delicious. There is a patio downstair and more setting. Service was very quick and the staff very helpful. If you're looking for Mediterranean food stop here its worth it!!!",

Everything is wonderfully cooked and all 8 of our dishes (shared amongst 3 people) came out in less than 15 minutes of ordering. They recommend that you order 2-4 dishes per person, and I think it is a wise recommendation. You'll be happy with anything you order, and there are many vegetable-based dishes as well as a meat based ones. Not sure if those vegetable dishes are actually vegetarian, but they were delicious!!",

It is obvious it was not carved off a spit just chunks of meat drenched in sauce. Also service was uncomfortably slow to the point of being ignored. Would not go back there are Kabab shops all over city with their meat rotating on Spits. Save your money!",

The food seems really fresh and authentic, and I was actually quite stunned by how delicious my vegetable kebab was. These vegetables were really succulent and tasty! The nan bread is vegan, and I chose a sauce to go with my kebab, which was a wholesome, thick veggie sauce and also remarkably tasty.   Service was quick and friendly, and portion sizes were very good.  Both me (vegan) and my very hungry boss (meat-eater) were delighted with our choices. We had rose sorbet to finish -  a massive portion.  Heads up that it's not licensed. There are plenty of non-alcoholic beers and wines (if that's your thing), but I had a peppermint tea - lovely with fresh mint leaves.",

    "text": "I'm trying to write this review but my fiance is trying to grab my phone out of my hand to write it because he is OBSESSED... OBSESSED I TELL YOU.   Tiny back story: I always try to get fiance to eat Med Food with me, because THIS GIRL LOVES THE SHAWARMA, alas in Los Angeles he always puts up a stink and winds up at the shawarma equivalent in the states: Chick Fil A.... (Bah ha ha HARDLY the same thing)... Any who, we got to Edinburgh around lunchtime just in time for HNAGRY GIGI to come out and sightsee. I was on a mission to find a place to eat, but nothing looked good. Being here once before, fiance recommended we walk over to the castle and explore the food options there because he recalls there being some good ones. I looked over at the vista.... The castle all fine and mighty in the distance... But all HANGRY GIGI could think is, FING CARRY ME because that castle is about 3 miles away and I am SOAKING WET, UNCOMFORTABLE & TIRED. Ha! I give fiance tons of credit for dealing with me... Seriously.   Anyways... What felt like an eternity later, we finally arrived at the castle but before going in FOOD WAS 10000000% necessary. Fiance couldn't find the restaurant he ate amazing food at the last time he was there... But there was a guy holding a sign for Afghan food/Kebob/Shawarma and I directed us over there.... Initially fiance was SKEPTICAL but he knew if he didn't feed me soon (and feed me food I actually wanted), he might not leave Edinburgh alive, thus he acquiesced...  WELL BOY IS HE GLAD HE DID BECAUSE THIS WAS BY FARTHE BEST MEAL HE HAS EVER HAD ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. I kid you not. He is going to be talking about it for the REST of his life.... The pita type bread served alongside his lamb shawarma in hummus was LIFE CHANGING apparently and has replaced me in his heart - lol!!! He was LICKING his bowl and ate all three HUGE PITAS... And they were massive!  I got the chicken shawarma, and while pretty good, it wasn't life changing... Dare I say I've had better in LOS ANGELES? I like a little cinnamon flavoring in my shawarma and this one didn't have any such flavors... Shockingly fiance let me have a tiny and I mean TINY bite of his lamb/hummus (I don't blame him for being stingy) and oh yes, it was insanely tasty. IF MY CHICKEN SHAWARMA came with hummus, the meal would have been better for sure.   We left full and satisfied, fiance over the moon... And it gave us lots of fuel to continue walking around COLD AND RAINY EDINBURGH. We even were the last people to leave the castle because he kept wandering around (to be fair, there is LOTSSSSSS to see in the castle).... And when we finally started walking down the hill again, fiance couldn't look at this restaurant again because he knew if he did, he'd want to get TAKE OUT, if nothing else, just for the pita bread.... We asked our server what it was made of and how it was made (my guess being correct)... Water, Salt & Flour... Baked like a pizza. I will however NOT try to re-create it because I know if I try, fiance will be disappointed with the results... Looks like this place needs to offer delivery to Los Angeles, ha!   Thank you for giving my fiance a life changing meal... And thank you for CURBING my hangry.",

We started with our usual hummus swarma and a mixed dolman starer but be warned.. there's so much food on this platter you'll be struggling! It comes with rice and bulgar wheat, some veg and a couple saucy side dishes like bamya..which prevents everything from being too dry!   We like this place because the food is fantastic (although is a sister business to. Pomegranate,  has a better menu I think) and service is usually pretty good!

It's decorated very lovely inside with beautiful lamps, textiles, and other art from the Middle East.   The naan was tasty as well as the eggplant dip. The hummus was okay as was the yogurt with cucumbers. Overall everything here needed salt.   The Kurdish style chicken biryani was a real disappointment. I would give that one star if I could, but the bread and eggplant that came with the biryani made up for it. The biryani tasted like it was DAYS old. The peas inside looked shriveled and old. The chicken had a weird crust on it that only old food gets. You all know what I mean. I'm sure they had made it days prior and microwaved it for us. The menu description made it sound so heavenly, but I urge you to take a pass on this dish.",

We tried quite a few dishes here, everything was well seasoned and the spices brought out the best in the food without overwhelming it. The lamb shawarma/hummus dish was phenomenal and quite memorable. Also the Qozy (sp?) lamb was a big hit (ordered off main menu). Vegetarian options were numerous and delicious, especially an aubergine/tomato dish we tried. And the huge naan-type bread was delicious enough to eat by itself. We surprised ourselves by eating as much as we did, but it was just that good.   Service was friendly, professional, and fast. Hope to stop back by when in Edinburgh.",
