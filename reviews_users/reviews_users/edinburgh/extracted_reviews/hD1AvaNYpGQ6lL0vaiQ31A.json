Probably largest selection of meats of any Chinese buffet we've been to globally Not as greasy as we are used to Very cool modern classy atmosphere Huge election of fresh salads Very reasonable price- just 10 pounds for lunch all  u can eat",

    "text": "China Red was an outstanding eat. I am one who has spent a month in China for business going all around and I'd have to say this place gives it a run for its money.   The chef at the seafood section was very friendly and enthusiastic as he whipped me up some scallops and prawns which were to die for.   One can also find amazing dim sum (the chinese call it Baozi) as well as an assortment of noodles, potstickers, and other great chinese food.   If you're along for the ride and don't feel like Chinese, there are still other good options. Moreover, I ate with a vegetarian and they were very pleased as well.  Highly recommend.",

Price-wise it's the same though and the quality's the same. Possibly fewer non-Asian options for kids though (i.e. maybe no pizza slices like at the other branch).  Good for office nights out etc. the same as the similar establishment it took over from.",

Chinese, Japanese, Western dishes, seafood, vegetarian, freshly cooked items, sushi, desserts etc. As buffets go it's a good option.   The restaurant was clean and well kept, with plenty staff on hand to help out if needed. There was also a bar you could order drinks from.   I must make it clear that this is a four star rating for the world of all-you-can-eat buffets. The meal here isn't as nice as going to a specialist restaurant, but if you're famished and need a good, proper feed on a budget this is a good food stop.",

    "text": "This is a new Chinese buffet just off Lothian Road, near the Lyceum theatre and Usher Hall. Situated in what was a Jimmy Chung's before, the place is perfectly set up to be a Chinese buffet, but they've still done a good job in decorating the place in such a way that it feels quite cool to be in. The lighting is good, bright around the food serving area, and dimmer where you sit to eat. The place was quite loud when we were there, but I'm glad to see it was doing so well in its first week of opening.  The food selection is great. It's got every Chinese dish I could think of. I always get excited at buffets and just piled my plate high with five different meats and sauces and plenty of rice and noodles as well. The flavours were all very nice, and the choice is good enough that you won't get bored on your second and third trips to the buffet. There is also a sushi area, but I don't like sushi, so no comments about that.  After dinner, you can choose from a selection of cakes, traybakes and ice cream for dessert, all included in the buffet price. All that's not included is drinks, but quick and efficient staff members ensure you are not thirsty for long.  Overall, as buffets go, this is a very good one, definitely worth trying out. The hustle and bustle probably rules it out if you're looking for a quiet, romantic meal (but who goes to a buffet for that anyway?), but there are plenty of seats, so going with a group of friends wouldn't be a problem.  By the way, 50% off until April 16th to celebrate its opening, so give it a try soon!",

    "text": "New Chinese buffet right next to Usher Hall. Went with some friends because of the half off deal for dinner.  The lower rating might just be because I'm not a huge fan of Chinese buffets, and the food at China Red seems like typical fare for a buffet. The atmosphere and interior of the restaurant is definitely a lot nicer than other Chinese buffets I've been too, but the food didn't wow me. They do have a good selection of meats, but only a few veggie options (the green beans were pretty good). Their dessert selection might even be more varied than the mains (macarons, ice cream, jello, fruit, cream puffs, cakes, and more!)   For a new restaurant, the service was pretty good, and I'm sure it will improve as they work out the kinks.   If you're a student looking to save some money or are happy with typical Chinese buffet food, then by all means give China Red a try. It's nothing spectacular for me, but it certainly does the job if you're craving a whole bunch of American-style Chinese food.",

    "text": "Giving this place 5 stars because as far as Chinese buffet goes, it's excellent. We went on a Sunday and the selection was really varied with Chinese, American, Japanese, and other cuisines on offer. There wasn't much in the way of vegetarian options so probably best avoided if you're not omnivorous. Their sushi was particularly nice and the dessert selection was huge. Bottles of wine come in at around 15 and they have a cocktail menu. This would be a good place to come on a lazy Sunday to sit with friends and family and graze for a couple of hours. The staff are friendly and helpful and I really don't have anything bad to say about it at all!",
