Or do you go to Burger King, get an outstanding Bacon Double Cheeseburger, and be guaranteed fries that taste like the contents of a paper shredder.  For me, it's usually a 50/50 choice, but if I'm feeling particulrly miserly, I'll opt for the 1.99 cheeseburger deal in here, where it all tastes like cardboard anyway.",

    "text": "As Burger Kings go this is pretty standard. It's busy and crowded and there's not as much space for standing and waiting for your order as I'd like for a fast food place in a station but apart from that it's fine. The staff are pretty great and do their best to get through the queues as quickly as possible (even when there's a bit of a language barrier with tourists' orders - I noticed one staff member in particular being really patient and helpful).  I wouldn't want to sit in, just because of the turnover rate for tables - it can't be easy to keep them clean and clear at peak times. However, for food to go it's fine and you don't normally have to wait for long. Since it's inside the station, you can get a 10% discount  with a Bite card, so I guess that's a small bonus that might push it just slightly ahead of other similar establishments nearby.",

    "text": "Ok. I'm going to level with you here. This place has saved my life on many, many occasions. I have a few friends in Glasgow so I take the train back and forth regularly, usually hungover, so this is the fatty, yucky food I need in that position. Ok, it;s Burger King, it's not exactly going to be Fois Gras, but it's delicious nevertheless. People have a go because it's not healthy or whatever, but sometimes you just need it. You know what  I mean....right?",

Also they say they have additional seating upstairs but they act like they're paying a 16th century window tax by having it in an enclosed, stuffy dim space. Wasn't feeling this BK at all. Oh well.",
