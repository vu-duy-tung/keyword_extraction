    "text": "The Orchard is quite simply my favourite restaurant in Edinburgh and I would urge everyone to try it. The food is exceptional from modern roast dinners, to souffle, to venison in chocolate and cherry gravy. All with a modern take and all very, very good. The staff are really helpful and the ambience is great, very chilled. There's a good range of types of spirits, beer etc. The place itself is bright and sunny, but for me the real winner is the food. In a city with so many excellent restaurants, the Orchard stands out as one of the best. I'm reluctant to let others know because it will get over-run once it's more widely discovered but it deserves to be. No one I have taken there has ever been disappointed. A real gem.",

    "text": "To be honest, this is either 3.5 or 4 stars, not sure but it serviced the need so I'll go with 4 stars as the service was nice and most of what we had was good.  Stopped here on the way to the botanical gardens, a perfect location for catching tourists!  The selection of ales is a bit on the low side, but they do have a variety of lagers and bigger name brand things.  So if that is what you are looking for, this place will work.    I had the bacon burger which was actually very good.  The DC had the smoked mackerel and the soup of the day.  The soup was a winner, but no point in describing it since it will be different by the time you go there.  The smoked mackerel was tasty but the issue was with the bread and the greens that came with it.  The fish spread was good and smoky but the bread that came with it was a bit over done.   The ratio of spread to bread is a bit off and you'll end up eating the spread straight when the bread runs out.    Service was good, as I said.  Just a little off to make a solid 4 stars, but worth a try and see what you think.  Might be there on a day where they don't burn the toast.",

Our pints and food arrived without delay.  The pint of Deuchars IPA was creamy & refreshing.  We tried two ciabatta sandwiches.  Our first selection was Brie, bacon, cranberry & mixed greens.  Very tasty and satisfying.  Our second selection was the pulled pork with an apple relish, which was good, but I preferred the Brie ciabatta.  Nice atmosphere, clean and tidy, tasty food and helpful servers.    What else could one ask for from a pub?    Give it a try after touring the gardens, you won't be disappointed.",

Waitresses and manager offered a very good and friendly customer service. The pub was rather busy with a couple of big tables with parents and well behaved toddlers & babies celebrating someone's birthdays. Because of that, our food took longer than usual to arrive at our table, but it was understandable.  I got the Steak and Merlot Pie with hand cut chips. My friends got the Ciabatta sandwich with ham, cheese and pickles accompanied with crisps, a 6.5 out of 10 treat as they told me. The Steak and Merlot Pie flavours were properly balanced and you can enjoy the red wine aftertaste. Also it was filled with abundant chucks of tender beef, which was a plus. All washed down with some Staropramen beer. All in all a very positive experience and, yes, we'll be back.",

As the first place we went to for a drink when we moved into the area five years ago, I've always made The Orchard one of our regular watering holes. The staff are friendly, the prices are reasonable, and although I've not sampled the food menu extensively, what I have had has been very tasty.  What I really like about The Orchard is the atmosphere. There's a mix of regulars who tend to take up residence at the bar and will always offer a tale or two to those who wander in, looking for a place to satisfy their thirst. There's also a great mix of ages, which I find really refreshing as some bars seem to have an unspoken age policy, but that's not the case in The Orchard.  I can't talk about the food in too much detail, but I have had the steak pie, which was delicious, and often my friends and I order chips whilst we work our way through our drinks. The chips are great, not thin and oily, but fat and fluffy.  I will always champion The Orchard, especially on a hot day, when you can sit outside and watch the world go by.",

Large, open room, loads of space, couches and big tables for groups so you could bring all your mates. A good selection of beer and wine, and decent prices. The staff is efficient, yet friendly and there's free wi-fi!   We came back for eats after a wander 'round the Botanical Gardens, having worked up a good appetite. Started off with haggis fritters (the boy's first introduction to haggis, drumroll please), smoked salmon and for mains split the catch of the day, which was sea bass.   The haggis fritters, for me, were the star of the show. Three plump fritters, deep-fried in a light batter, served over stewed, lightly curried apples. The flavors were spot-on. The salmon was quite delicious, but the portion was rather tiny for 6 - but it did come with a scoop of wasabi ice cream! I didn't eat them together as I found the flavors didn't quite mesh, but the novelty of it (wasabi ice cream!) was great fun. The sea bass was quite good as well, perfectly grilled atop a tower of crushed new potatoes and wilted spinach, surrounded by a moat of tiny shrimp. Simple, but hearty.   The meal wasn't cheap, and the portions weren't for the hearty eaters, but for innovation and great flavors the Orchard gets a solid four stars.",

I'm not saying we're going in every night, but about once a week/once a fortnight kind of frequent.    No mater what time of day it is always comfortably busy, which to me is a sign of a very good local.    It has been nice to see that the staff are obviously fed well, get on with eachother and have fun, while not appearing to take the piss.  One of the managers is also one of if not the best food service manager I've ever had the pleasure of observing.  He knows his customers, knows what they like to eat and drink, where they like to sit, and is a whiz at multitasking.  And, despite the fact that we're not exactly regulars, he recognized and said hello to us in the street the other day.  I'm very impressed.",

It is a relatively quiet and friendly neighbourhood pub with a regularly changing Scottish based menu featuring classic dishes like fish and chips, although here they call it 'deep fried angel cut haddock with hand cut roosters'. Between 12-3pm they do a selection of 'fresh gourmet' sandwiches on ciabatta and these are rather good. The crayfish tails with coriander and lime mayo was an inspired filling idea and tasted lovely, it came served on a slate with some salad and a good sized pile of kettle chips - well worth 6.   It is worth mentioning that they do table service, so even if you're only in for a couple of drinks you need not get up from your seat - make sure you keep a tally of the bill though, as it is very easy to let it spiral out of control when you're not paying as you go.",

Their hot chocolate was so nice, it was frothy and didn't burn my mouth! It was one of the nicest ones I've had (which is quite a lot as I'm not a coffee/tea person!)   My aunt had their mushroom and tarragon soup, which tasted fantastic and was very thick and came with 3 slices of bread and was only 3 which we thought was good value.   A nice place to relax and I'm interested to try more of their food in the future!",

    "text": "If you haven't eaten here, you really should!  The Orchard is quite simply my favourite restaurant in Edinburgh and I would urge everyone to try it.  The food is exceptional from modern roast dinners, to souffle, to venison in chocolate and cherry gravy.  All with a modern take and all very, very good.  The staff are really helpful and the ambience is great, very chilled.  There's a good range of types of spirits, beer, cider etc.  The place itself is bright and sunny, but for me the real winner is the food.  In a city with so many excellent restaurants, the Orchard stands out as one of the best.  I'm reluctant to let others know because it will get over-run once it's more widely discovered but it deserves to be.  No one I have taken there has ever been disappointed.  A real gem.",
