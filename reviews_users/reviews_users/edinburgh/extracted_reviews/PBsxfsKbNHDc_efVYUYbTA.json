The bar staff are really chilled and friendly, the food is good and has a menu to cover allsorts.  I've had the nachos and fahitas and can say thumbs up. The other half has had the fish & chips and chilli beef which also has the thumbs up.  They do a quiz night on Sundays, which is the reason we go.  One reason to get out of the house and meet friends!",

    "text": "We've visited this place fairly often over the last few years, usually for food.  It's a nice, almost cafe-like atmosphere in the day, and much more bustling with sport on the telly in the evenings.  The disappointing thing is that food seems to have gone downhill.  It used to have a small-ish but reasonably priced and tasty menu of pub standards.  The menu has been revamped at some point in the last few months, and both mains we ordered last time (a hot dog and nachos) were very disappointing, and a big step down in quality to what we've gotten used to there.  On the positive side, there's a good range of drinks, and neither the food or drinks are expensive.  Still, I'd be wary of eating there again.",

    "text": "I walked by the Waiting Room about a million times before I finally wrangled The Man to come for a drink with me.  It was the fact that they have Black Isle on tap that did it for him.  What did it for me is the art deco vibe.  I'm quickly realising that I love all things art deco/art nouveau/arts & crafts and it's enough to draw me in anywhere.    So, a few weeks ago, we finally went.  The bottled drink selection was very good- though they could probably benefit from a drinks menu somewhere.  The staff were friendly and  nudged me in the direction of a better brew when I was uncertain.  The decor was generally as expected.    Unfortunately this was a Friday night and I wonder if the same crowd frequents this place on a Friday night as on a Saturday.  We were faced with chats from drunken older men who had stopped in at 5 and were still there at 9:30/10.  There were girls who looked liked they were on a proper night out.  There were guys there to oogle said girls.  It felt like we were in the city center and not tucked away in an art deco pub in Morningside.  However, I hear it's much better after work and I hear the food's pretty decent, so I will give it another chance to wow me away from my other Morningside favourites.",

However I haven't been in a while and I went back this weekend for a meal I remembered would be great but it was one of the worst meals I've EVER had. Very basic tasteless food. It took a very very long time for food to arrive. Service was really not great from the waitresses who both served us. Our order had an extreme dietary requirement mistake and I had to question it after I started to feel ill. I do NOT recommend going here and I'm really sorry to write this but hopefully one day it improves to its old high standard.",

    "text": "First review, ever, so be gentle and use lubrication. I mean have a drink! Filthy folk. The Waiting room is just around the corner from home and is probably, in my humble opinion, one of the best bars in the Morningside area. Not that difficult really as there's only another couple to annoy it. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is cheap, cheerful and filling. Usually a good selection of local (Scottish anyway) beers on offer. The only down side for me is the large number of fitba screens dotted around. I cannae stand fitba. Other than that, good place for a pint and some pub grub. If you can do so between fitba games all the better. It would have been 4 stars but due to fitba -1 to 3.",

    "text": "A great place to unwind, this. It's often quiet, they serve high quality comfort food and the chairs and sofas are especially plush and squashy, so in a way it's like being in Starbucks. With a pint. (Now THERE'S an idea).   This bar has much more character than a Starbucks though (so does the little shed where I chuck my bin bags) but it's in a relaxed, subtle way; unlike Canny Mans say, where the decor is foisted upon you.   The overall WR look is modern and pleasing with wooden flooring, eclectic drinks, pretty staff, brown leather upholstery and gleaming metal fixtures. It would be a good place to take people with differing tastes or a first date (eyes off the staff though).",

The only down-side is that they can be a bit slack with checking up on how you're getting on and getting you more drinks. The place is pretty big and the booths comfortable enough to spend all day in, trust me I've done it on many occasions!",

The atmosphere is cosy and friendly as the area of Edinburgh is quite classy - a mix of families and students. Morningside Road is a great place to live and socialise if you aren't keen on going into town all the time. The big draw of this place is the food - really well priced and tasty. The menu has a great mix of Thai, Indian and traditional British grub and the drinks are well priced. A great evening's craic!",

I will NEVER go back there ever!!!",
