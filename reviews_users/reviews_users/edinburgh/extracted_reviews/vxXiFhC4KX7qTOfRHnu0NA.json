    "text": "Having an American friend over to visit, I had to introduce him to the highlights and the lowlights of Scottish fare - deep fried pizza (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/rainbow-restaurant-musselburgh\">yelp.co.uk/biz/rainbow-r...</a>); delicious ice cream (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/s-luca-musselburgh\">yelp.co.uk/biz/s-luca-mu...</a>); tablet, broon sauce, pies and the such like, I felt it was required to show him a little more of the high life that us Scots enjoy. He wanted to try haggis before he departed our shores, so we took him to Stac Polly to see what they would come up with.   Stac Polly definitely has highs and lows:  Lows: * sample menu online is the same as they used on the day we visited - less sample, more stock - bit disappointing as it gave the impression that there was a rotational menu, perhaps on local availability, but it wasn't the case * no vegetarian main course. That's just poor show, chaps * Cranachan dessert. Given that Stac Polly was the place that introduced me to this fantastic dessert, it was extremely disappointing. Oatmeal that was left far too long in cream and whisky, turning what should be light, into a cream/oatmeal cake. The raspberries in sauce felt like they came from a tin and far too sweet - gave the heavy cream little if no contrast and became an overwhelmingly rich and unpleasant dessert. Came out far too quickly and clearly sitting in a fridge for longer than necessary. Less haste, more pleasure! * As the place was heaving, service was a little harried, but the waitress herself was perfectly pleasant.  * No steak knives for the steak, which was a little on the tough side  Highs * Accomodated my request to remove meat from one of the fish dishes so I could eat it but found random broccoli in the risotto - I have a food intolerance to the stuff, so rather bemused to find it on my plate. along with some buried beans - suspect there was a plating malfunction! * Lamb was apparently perfectly cooked and cut beautifully  Overall, I am less impressed with Stac Polly than I used to be - I didn't feel the quality of the food was as good as I remember when this place was a regular haunt for myself and my family - it's good, but it's just not that good that I would necessarily pick this as a place to take guests again.",

We were treated like we were trying to pull a con and get some money off our bill, when my husband had actually found the meat to be tough and just about inedible. Will never go back and think this company need to retrain their staff to show customers a bit of respect and remember where their incomes comes from.",

This is my all time favourite restaurant, tucked away in a basement, full of charm, character and scottish tradition. The food is outstanding - I cannot recommend highly enough the Haggis Parcels to start - they are outstanding! The choice is limited (which I like) but the quality is outstanding. The food is locally sourced, the wine list is very good, the whisky is outstanding, the ambience is formal yet relaxed, the decor is beautiful and the staff are great. It's a special treat to visit Stac Polly, I think I might just book up soon!",

For the first course we had the pheasant and he haggis which were both outstanding. Mains consisted of their generously portioned lamb shank and the sea bass. The sticky toffee pudding looked and sounded so good that we refused to share it and each got our own. Reasonably priced glasses of wine and whiskey were also fantastic. Our server provided excellent recommendations and was a warm and gracious host. If you're ever looking for a sensibly prices upscale meal in Edinburgh this is a must visit. For two people each having two drinks, a first, a main, and a dessert the bill came to 128 with the service charge.",

The set menu included bread, tomato soup with pumpkin seeds, a main course (salmon, chicken or lamb) and a raspberry chocolate torte with ice cream for dessert. I had the salmon as the main with potatoes and vegetables. All the food was absolutely decadent. Plus, I heard that the lamb was to die for!  Great service, especially for serving a large group. Lovely mix of rustic and modern decor.",

    "text": "We had dinner at Stac Polly with a fairly large group on our first night in Scotland.  This place is absolutely amazing!  The atmosphere in the basement is cozy, but comfortable.  Since we had a large group, the menu was preset but there wasn't a single complaint from our group.    There was wine on every table as well as bread and butter to start.  Our first course was a soup of some sort of squash, pumpkin and pine nuts (I think).  It was delicious!  From there, we were able to pick from a selection of entrees of either chicken, salmon or lamb.  I promise, Reno Yelpers, I do get more adventurous with eating as the trip continues on.  But for this night, I had the chicken and Jason went with the salmon.  The salmon was in a savory butter sauce and melted in your mouth.  But the chicken won the round hands down.  You didn't really even need a fork for this chicken, let alone a knife.  If you stared at it long enough, it would fall apart.  I have never had a piece of chicken breast be that juicy and tender at the same time.  YUM!  For dessert, we were served a cheesecake that had some sort of sauce - I'm assuming whisky, covering it so of course that was delicious too.  Again, I'm kicking myself for not taking pictures of the food so you'll have to use your imagination.  The food was just great and the service was fantastic for our large group.    On our next trip to Scotland, we will make a point of finding Stac Polly again.",

The food itself is spectacular ... our party had the beef fillet, the lamb rump, and a vegan dish that i cant think of at the moment, and everyone was extremely haopy!

    "text": "(I've added a few pictures to this restaurant's page from their own website, I hope they don't mind.)   Like the earlier reviewer this restaurant came highly recommended by our hotel, which arguably has the best goddamn concierge in the UK. For fellow travelers, once the restaurant filled up there were noticeably few Americans in the place. Please don't get the impression that this is a tourist trap. In fact, its better if you don't tell anyone else about this place or it could get as difficult to get into as the Wedgwood. The food was certainly as good.    First the atmosphere was well done, stone with tasteful tartan accents. Impeccably Scotttish as was the food. With the layout and the lighting it was romantic, this is not a kid-friendly restaurant.   The service was amiable and attentive, if a bit difficult to understand at times. As I've noticed at most of the UK restaurants I visited this summer; the staff are from the EU countries in deepest economic crisis (Spain, Greece and Italy were all well represented). But this was a relatively minor hassle. And the food was worth it.  The beer was excellent and local, you can't ask for more than that.  I started with the haggis wontons in a wine reduction. They were an unusual combination of sweet, umami and spicy that was enjoyable. I followed with the salmon. You really can't go wrong with scottish salmon, it was tender and flavorful. My father had the venison dish, and I tried some. Dear god, I almost regretted my order. It was unlike any American venison I had ever had. It was sweet, tender and completely lacking any gaminess. It tasted like a combination of buffalo sweetness and kobe juiciness.   Anyway, go there. Its a bit off the beaten path of the Royal Mile, but go there anyway. And for god's sake don't tell anyone about it. I want to be able to get in easily when I go back to Edinburgh.",

The surroundings reminded me of the inside of an Tudor Barn home stead, they even had the alcove open hearth.  We were greeting with great enthusiasm.   I am firstly impressed with the fact that we were able to use their normal menu, unlike other restaurants that present special voucher menus. The only extra was a supplement on the steak and drinks. So if you are picking up a voucher for this place, you get a real deal!   Second I need to mention the service; pleasant, friendly and efficient. No faults or mishaps detected throughout our visit.   And lastly I commend them for the chef's skill. Our Ham Hock Terrine and homemade pickle was delicious. The Rabbit was brilliantly paired with the black pudding. My Aberdeen Angus Fillet steak was cooked to perfection and the whole peppercorn sauce was rich and full of flavour. We finished with a rich Chocolate Cheesecake - this proved to be indeed very dense and rich. (Mostly finished off by Anita A.)  - Portion sizes of all meals were spot on.  The normal prices are 22 for the Rabbit and 27 for the Steak. For the quality and skill I would be prepared to pay that.   Also wine by the glass is in relation to the bottle price. Nice.   The coffee came with a fudge (hey, it is a Scottish Fare restaurant after all) which was buttery and sweet.   All in all it was over and beyond my personal expectations. This place has the service, the chefs and the ambience deserving of a 5 star review.  We will definitely go back here this year without the aid of a voucher",

The food was stunning, as always, and at a very reasonable price. The starter of Baked filo pastry parcels of finest haggis, sweet plum and red wine sauce was a real crowd-pleaser (every plate was perfect) and eloquently introduced the Roasted rump of Borders lamb with mustard and herb crust, aubergine and red onion tart tatin, star anise carrots, fine beans and game jus. Everyone who ordered the Vanilla pod creme brulee underlain by summer fruit compote all agreed they could have eaten a gallon on it!  I cannot emphasis strongly enough the quality of food and cooking at Stac Polly. I have enjoyed Scottish fine dining in a number of highly acclaimed restaurants in Edinburgh but not one outstrips a meal at Stac Polly. The attentive and relaxed service in a warm and understated atmosphere results in an experience reminiscent of a good meal and excellent company in the home of close friends with the benefit of someone else clearing the table :) I can't wait to go back!",

I find online deal meals can be very hit and miss, but in this case I would come back to Stac Polly for sure.   I went to the restaurant on Dublin Street, which is down in the bowels of a building. So it's not got anything in the way of natural light and it feels a bit catacomb-like, but for romantic atmosphere that's probably a definite bonus.   The service was speedy and polite. Waiters and waitresses kept us well-watered and fed and were very pleasant to chat to.   The food itself was lovely. I ordered a game terrine with piccalilli to start and it was delicious. My main course was lamb with lentils and various other veggies and it was the best piece of lamb I have eaten in a very long time. Yum!  The only thing I would say about this place is that it's pricey. It's over 20 for a main course so you had better be expecting some very nice food indeed for that price. But for the quality of food and atmosphere, I'd say it's definitely worth it for a birthday meal or special night out.",

( Plus, when travelling w/ parents, you're eating the early bird timetable which actually works out well since we're almost always guaranteed reservations )   There were 2 guys still setting up for the evening - 1 invited us in & the other looked incredibly & apparently perturbed. Gee - I'm sorry....shall we go stand out in the rain for 15 min while you finish your conversation? Not a good start to our evening...   I likened their dark beer (Caledonian Ale) to more of an amber ale & tried 2 different varieties but thought they were both lacking a certain something   Started out w/ a Poached Pear w/ Cheese - it was okay but cold.  Guess this is what we get for being the 1st to dine - things right out of the fridge  Both Mom & Dad had the Salmon which they enjoyed    My Veggie Risotto was crunchy - nuff said   Only Dad ordered dessert - the Strawberries & Cream & the verdict was delish. The strawberries were super sweet & when combined w/ the cool fresh cream, it was perfection   Would be willing to give this place another try & it's not like we hated our meals ( well, I did ).....we just weren't wowed & for this kind of , we would probably seek elsewhere next time",

We discovered a nice restaurant, going down a few stairs, old and cosy. Just looked comfortable and welcoming.  The food is quite typical, offering traditional Scottish food, from haggis to nice fish. It's all good and tasty. But even though it appears to be quite fresh,I had the impression some of the plates where from food prepared in advance, easy to finish the cooking on the spot. There was no \"wow\" factor.  Service was quick and efficient.  So all in all good food, nothing amazing, but you will still have a good dinner.",

The lamb rack lacked True glavour, but the sauce added in a more palatable element. Unfortunately, the sticky toffee pudding for dessert was not great, but edible.",

I had the Portobello mushroom on Brioche which was the most delicious thing I have eaten.  We ordered desert which was also great.  Good service, good ambiance, great food!",

    "text": "Probably the best known Scottish restaurants even thought their approach is rather contemporary, you wouldn't know this from the outside with heather coloured walls and the fact you're standing on a very Scottish cobbled street.  The choices of meat are very native, a lot of salmon on the menu and also a lot of venison. Being a big fish eater I was even tempted away and enjoyed a wonderfully tender piece of meat.  Oh dear, the bill, now this is one for the tourists to work out, if you want real Scottish food (excluding deep-fried haggis) then I couldn't recommend anywhere better, but if you were after just a nice meal out - there's plenty of other places of the same quality without the niche but hefty price tag.",

    "text": "Game in rich sauce, seafood, little cubes of tablet with your coffee - Stac Polly does good Scottish/ French-style food. It's a pleasant venue*, staff are friendly ... so it's hard to put my finger on why it's just not that exciting.   First, I have to say that everything I ate was delicious - scallops in their shell, pheasant with chestnut puree, a nice bottle of red and then coffee. J's partridge was tasty but a bit tough, but the venison was amazing.   Like Catriona, I find the fact the menu doesn't change a bit disconcerting - they must get bored with doing the same stuff, surely? Shouldn't it depend what's good on the day/ week? But .. they do it well, plenty of practice, I suppose!   I would go back if I had visitors to Edinburgh who would appreciate good Scottish ingredients - you can get haggis in a fairly safe and non-scary little filo parcel, for example! But not if anyone in the group was vegetarian, as there's nothing at all listed for them to eat. And if it's just the two of us - probably not. There's too many other places in Edinburgh to try.   *I won't blame them for the lack of phone coverage/ wifi, but it was frustrating for a geek like me. And it's odd that everything's downstairs, leaving an empty waiting-room area on street level. Going up there to go to the loo was vaguely alarming - who knew who had walked in off the street and was hanging about in this empty area?  (Oh, and it bugs me when restaurants add a service charge. Feels sneaky, and like they think you don't know to tip, We tip! But if you put a  service charge on then you're not getting a penny more than that.)",

    "text": "Traditional Scottish restaurant that does what it says on the tin. Old school dishes (game, beef, salmon) served in a traditional environment in the New Town. It ticks the box nicely if that's what you're after but hard to think of a reason to go more than once in a blue moon because it's exactly the same all the time.  I had partridge for my starter which was mixed. The breast and the cabbage and bacon accompaniment were excellent, but the wee leg was charred beyond recognition. I couldn't get into it with cutlery and was forced to pick it up and take a bite . . . but I couldn't. Absolutely rock hard. Really didn't match with the quality of the rest of the dish and the quality of everything else we ate. Maybe it was just one of those things. The venison main was excellent though. The staff were nice, the place is very nicely turned out, if not quite as warm as it could be, so it's a good place that I would consider taking someone who wanted olde worlde charm, but there wasn't really anything to drag me back.  And while having the restaurant downstairs is nice enough (although it blocks your phone reception...!), the empty upstairs bit that's open to the street is bizarre. A few tables and chairs with no apparent purpose, and you need to go up there to reach the toilet. Weird.  So I'm a bit torn on how many stars to give. Other than my cremated partridge leg, the food was very good, and it's a nice place, but somewhat meh at the same time.",
