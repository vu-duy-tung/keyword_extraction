Two pizzas should serve 4 people.  A bit pricey ($38) for a pizza, garlic fries, two soft drinks and a coffee. Quality was good.",

    "text": "My first time having a Toni macaroni's and I was a extremely disappointed, not by the the food, the food was lovely although there was nothing really THAT appealing that really got me excited to be honest. But it was the service that was the major let down. First of all our waiter forgot or mixed up bits of our order, he continued to pile Parmesan cheese onto my aunts meal when she had told him to stop, he asked her why she didn't eat all her soup, putting her on the spot, you just don't do that and he practically hurried us out the door before we even had time to digest but worse than that was the hefty service charge of 20 on top of our bill which I think is rude anyway and the manager grumbling at the fact that we all paid separately. So I won't be dining there again for the simple fact they are money grabbers and try to get as much money from you as they can. Disgrace!!",

Had the Starter Capantano with bread, and it tasted amazing, had so much flavour, even better than my main which was the Sea Food Linguini - it was decent but nothing to rave about (however the pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente). For the cocktails priced at 5.95 (cheap when you live in London), they were really nothing special at all, the Pina Colada left a funny taste in my mouth.",

I generally go in with low expectations to shopping centre restaurants, but the Yelp Monocle wasn't showing any quality restaurants in the area and I thought Italian sounded the best option amongst the lot.  I thought I'd try a few options off he menu I've never noticed in Australian Italian restaurants and'd thought were some kind of Italian-Scottish fusion (puff pastry, mashed potato and beef covered in a thick minestrone-like sauce?), but to my pleasant surprise, the ingredients came together well and they had Birra Moretti on tap!  I felt relaxed, reading my Kindle between courses and never feeling rushed or intruded on, and left absolutely beaming when Andrea, the head waiter bid me Arrivederci and when I looked over to thank him, saw him inexplicably creating balloon animals for two girls at another table (seriously?).  Definitely see myself going back here.",

    "text": "I'm not often at the Omni Centre,  but we needed something to eat and Tony M had a table available at that time. So we thought,  why not! The staff was mega efficient.  So fast with clearing unwanted dishes from the table or delivering the orders, even the place was packed on a Saturday evening.  There might have been a slight hiccup with my friends order, but this was soon rectified.  The menu choice is vast and you can choose from meat, chicken, pizza, vegetables, pastas, burgers, ribs, Mini Italian choices , bruschetas, not to mention all the starters and delicious desserts. The ice cream list is long and a delight for young and old.  For a main I ordered a stone oven pizza with mozzarella cheese, capers, anchovies and olives. The pizza Napoli does not normally have olives nor capers on it, so they were a pound each. Having said this, they had run out of capers, but still added the add on to the bill. Naughty :-)  As a starter we shared some tasty olives and garlic bread. For dessert we chose Affogato,  which was not on the menu,  but they served a scoop of ice cream and espresso, which we could mix. The vanilla scoop was very Italian style, creamy with a hint of vanilla and the coffee was one of a kind too. I had ordered Prosecco with the meal. No wonder, as it is also a Prosecco bar. Very nice tasting Prosecco indeed. You can buy the bottles too. They also offer a range of the well known Cocktails like Mojito or even Kirk Royal. Have a look at the drink list. This includes soft drinks.  Toilets are clean and modern. Nice wooden doors. The interior of the place is very contemporary and the space is larger what you think.  All in all it was a very enjoyable evening.",

    "text": "My mum and me almost walked past this place in the Omni when we were looking for somewhere to eat before going to the cinema. Luckily, I was drawn in by the glitzy-looking decor and bright lights. We were greeted with a really friendly host for the night, who showed us to our table. I was surprised by the secret size of the place - it reaches far back beyond the glam Prosecco Bar at the front window.  The vast menu covered a range of Italian dishes yet my mum and me, going against the grain, both plumped for burgers and chips. The portions were decently sized, not too big (which all too often puts me off). The brioche-type bun was fresh, the beef itself was tender, and the chips were particularly fluffy. We were too pushed for time to consider dessert, but there looked to be a pretty wide range of delights to be had in that department. I'll just have to make a return journey to find out!  One thing to make clear was that, as we found out towards the end of the meal, we were there on the opening night. As such, there were a lot of waiting staff (too many, perhaps, but best to be over-staffed than under-staffed). They were all incredibly friendly and attentive, and I hope they can keep up the good work a few weeks after opening.",

I recommend the ribs, the ribs and the ribs.  Equally, any pizza, especially the Triolese with chips (yes, chips) is a lovely moment in your day.  Just go.",
