Highly recommend. Nom nom nom. Everything tasted so good. Service was fast, servers were really accommodating.",

When I told the waitress she said  \"yes, we soak it in meat. You didn't tell me you were vegetarian.\"  Ordering only vegetarian dishes is not a clue to tell diners that the bread has chunks of meat in it?  What kind of restaurant serves meat bread and doesn't label it ?!  Don't go here.",

I didn't enjoy the vine leaves, but I had never had them before so I didn't have anything to compare it too. The hummus and kebab was absolutely delicious though and they brought out warm fresh bread to dip with. I would go again!",

    "text": "Unfortunate... we stopped here because the nearby highly rated restaurant was not open yet and we were starving.   We ordered the iskinder kabob and something else that was basically chicken on a bed of eggplant. Maybe it was that we were American, they gave us two little mezzes and a salad on the house. But it just didn't make up for the completely underwhelming flavors of both dishes. The iskender was basically kobida with a poor attempt at a tomato sauce. If you like the taste of burned food this is it.",

The bread was delicious but the rest didn't thrill me.  We all enjoyed our mains but again weren't overwhelmed.  The service was very very good though so I'm willing to accept that my a-ok experience could have just been a poor representation of the restaurant as a whole.",

We stopped in for some take away and were treated to hot Turkish tea while we watched our sis kebab being prepared over the open charcoal brazier. The mixed mezza platter was delicious and plentiful, the felafel crisp and well spiced, and the three additional containers of sauces, charred onions and mushrooms, and sauteed onions plus were icing on the cake. And they made sure we took some Turkish Delight as we left.",
