It is almost a cheap imitation of the likes of Hard Rock Cafe and TGI Fridays.  The menu is full of burgers, steaks, pastas, salads and sandwiches. We went in one lunch time when they were offering a cheap lunch deal. I had fish and chips which were too much like Birds Eye fish and McCains chips for my liking. I have been on other occasions and had a burger which I was quite happy, so it earns an extra star. The service is usually quite quick and friendly which earns it another star.   Overall there ain't much to make this restaurant better than mediocre.",

For my starter I had the beer battered mushrooms with garlic mayo which were nice, the mushrooms were big, I liked the mayo and there were plenty of them. My boyfriend had tomato soup, which came with some bread, I tasted it and that was also really nice.   However for my main, I had the margherita pizza and - similarly to my experience in Frankie and Benny's not long before - it had hardly any cheese on it at all! Also, there were slices of tomato on it, which meant that the cheese which was there hadn't melted properly so I was quite disappointed! My boyfriend had macaroni cheese which he said was nice.",

They have burgers, fajitas, steaks, salads, and a lovely selection of desserts and cocktails. As an American, this is one of the very few places in Edinburgh that I will buy fajitas from and trust them to be reasonably authentic.   The Rose Street location is over two levels. It's easy to miss the stairs down to the basement, but if the upper level is crowded, try the door at the side for a set of stairs down into the dimmer, larger, underground bar.   I recommend going for a booth if you can, after all, that's the quintessential American experience.",

They had a great lunch menu deal which was specific meals and you can also do a drink.   I opted for the crispy chicken wrap that came with fries and their coleslaw. It took awhile to get.   It's not American portions so that was good. Lol. But the food was not that great. It seems as though the we ap was heated up after it was built so lettuce got heated and was soggy. The chicken was good but so is chicken you make from a bag of frozen tenders. I didn't touch the coleslaw just because I was filled with the wrap and the fries. But I was disappointed that I went here when there are many places to choose from.   The price was good. The service was so friendly. But unless you're dying for American food, skip it.",

This location is even worse than the Royal Mile one, where they won't even seat you or bring you food until they are finished making phone calls to their boyfriends or flirting with the bar staff.  My party of six was told we would have to wait 15-20 minutes for a table. As we waited by the bar, three adults and a baby walked in and were immediately taken to a table that would seat eight. We continued to wait, and eventually were given a booth which would have comfortably fit only four people.  I ordered the Lux burger, cooked medium. The menu describes it as: \"Our prime burger stacked with rocket, Emmental cheese, garlic mayo, two rashers of streaky bacon, red onion, SunBlush tomatoes and dill pickle. Served in a soft white bun served with your choice of fries and a spicy ketchup dip.\"  My \"medium\" burger arrived so cooked that it was burnt and reminded me of the sole of an old shoe. It also did not have rocket, cheese, red onions, or tomatoes and only one slice of bacon. It had taken 45 minutes to get to the table, and at which point the waiter was no where to be found for 20 more minutes so I couldn't even ask for the rest of the ingredients that were left off. My friends at least received what they ordered, but all of them thought it was so bad that they did not finish their meals. Two of us had stomach problems later that night.",

While I've been to that restaurant in Maryland, I found that this one is much better!! I was surprised positively! The service was amazingly friendly! As I ordered a very cold strawberry daiquiri, the glass soon turned out to be very slippery which made me drop it. The glass didn't break, but I spilled half the cocktail over the table and myself. The staff was very helpful and generous - they made me a new one! And since I had no time to stay longer, they gave it to me to go! In a coffee cup so it didn't look like I was drinking alcohol while on the run! Absolutely great!! Never had this experience before! The burger and fries was also good :-)  If you want friendly staff and great american food for good money - what are ya waitin' for?! ;-)",

It's not... it's just that there are so many other places that would probably be better deserving of my pounds...  So, it's a Monday morning. My husband has decided to go hike Arthur's seat with a friend who ran up it and then came back down to meet him to walk up it. Yes. That dude did it twice in one day. I am a firm believer of know-your-limit-play-within-it, so I went to breakfast with the others instead. Wonderful breakfast mates who wanted to shop after.  Place is empty. We get seated in a booth and brace ourselves for the American-ness of this place. Meh. It's a regular restaurant. I had the sausage and egg sandwich and an Americano. That's easy. One friend got the vegetarian breakfast minus the eggs (she's not, but was eating healthy to fit in her wedding dress) and her hubby-to-be got the bacon and egg sandwich with a side of hasbrowns. He asked what kind of hashbrowns they had. Our server looked at him like he asked what animal chicken eggs come from. I could feel the you're-dumb glare. She said they were fried. Still didn't explain: we were going more for are they homemade, are they potatoes just fried, are they packaged? I guess she thought we would know what American hashbrowns would be? For future, they have the disc kind, like the ones from McDonalds. Deep fried and good...   My sandwich was okay... my sandwich was just sausage and eggs. I don't know what I was expecting, but it's exactly as they say on their menu. It's sausages stuffed into a bun with an egg. My egg was a little runny, which I like. It was just ordinary. It sufficed... the bun was a little sweet which worked well for the sandwich.  The place is good enough. Kind of expensive for what it is.",

American diner, serving American style food in reasonable to big portions. Alongside cocktail and American style beers (and Tennent's) Should I stop here? I could. Perhaps I should not to put you off. Still interested? OK.  The place is big, 2 floors and 2 bars and many tables and booths. The main bar on the ground floor is where the till works, the downstairs bar it has been kaput for absolutely donkeys years. So when eating downstairs you need to order at the table (group of 4 or less? no sweat) or go upstairs and wait, wait, wait... wait some more to get served. Just for your information, a corona is 3.95 - yes .. a pint of Guinness is 3.20 - Pretty expensive for an MotR American diner.. We were on a prepaid meal of about 30 people we didn't want the hassle of divvying up the drinks bill so we had to go to the upstairs when thirsty. This lead to many people arriving to cold starters or mains..  Granted they offered to open a bill per table, but unbeknownst to us we opted for ordering at the bar..  The food was well received (especially the salmon and pesto pasta) but mostly bland. Or overuse of sauce (do I taste BBQ sauce - again?) salads and coleslaw sides - nah.   The food service was speedy and accurate (remembering each dish ordered belonging to whomever ordered it as a preorder. well done!)  however i will not be back in a hurry.",

My boyfriend and I wanted a quick bite and this place looked fine. It is an American diner, which usually means burgers, pastas and chips, just what we were looking for. I ordered the cajun chicken penne pasta with garlic bread.  Our meals came about 20 minutes later, which I thought was quite a long time to wait somewhere where the food is clearly not 100% freshly made. My pasta landed on the table, and I was really horrified. The sauce was burnt to the ramekin and the pasta was rock hard on top. I fished through it to find the chicken, of which there was maybe 3 or 4 small bits. It was packed full of peppers and onions too, the latter of which I despise, but it wasn't specified on the menu they were in it. I picked at it for ten minutes before accepting defeat and nibbling on the dry garlic bread. Scunnered.  If I wasn't such a loser I would have complained, but we paid our bill which came to around 26 and left swiftly. My advice: Just don't do it!",

I opted for a bacon roll and pancakes and G-Bot got the Caledonian Breakfast. I'm not going to lie, it wasn't the best breakfast I've ever eaten and the pancakes were a little bit measly but my bacon roll was delicious as the roll it came in was delicious as it was soft but slightly crispy at the same time.   The girl serving us was nice but the service was more help-yourself-to-a-menu sort of style which was fine for me as I just wanted a basic brekkie.  Rather average but fairly tasty and I liked to laid back atmosphere too. The toilets were also very clean and much more modern than I'd expected.",
