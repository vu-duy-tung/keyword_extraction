    "text": "The Spicy Pot is such a good idea, every town should have one!  Like Stuart said, the best way to describe it is a Med Subway, with ciabattas, baguettes and wraps filled with delicious fillings like chorizo, roast chicken, Mediterranean roasted veggies, feta and spinach. It's just a bit different from the norm, and they even do tasty salad boxes filled with meat or veggie options, for around 3.  Nothing is very expensive and almost everything is under the 3 mark, with options to sit in or take-away. They have a small selection of cakes and home made pies, which finish off a healthy lunch perfectly!",

    "text": "Getting out of Princess Street and onto Leith Walk is almost a humbling journey. Cafes down this way spend less time showing off with expensive decor and more time on the food.  The Spicy Pot is like a Mediterranean Subway, very healthy sized portions of your favorite sandwich or wrap combos. But that's also the biggest problem with this place, the menu options are limited. This is a real shame because they put me together a very nice Club, made exactly how I wanted it and it tasted divine.   They are more than capable than producing excellent Med food, I hope they take a chance an expand the menu!",

The spicy humous could do with being a bit spicier (I mean, they're called \"Spicy Pot\") but other than that, it's a great and welcome place on Leith Walk.",
