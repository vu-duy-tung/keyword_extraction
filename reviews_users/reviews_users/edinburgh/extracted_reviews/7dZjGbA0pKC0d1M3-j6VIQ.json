    "text": "Robertsons 37 bar is a cosy pub which is situated on Rose Street in the city centre of Edinburgh.   The pub is very cosy and has a large bar with some wooden chairs and tables nearby and a lounge area at the back with more comfortable cushioned seating.   The pub is quite old fashioned but offers an excellent level of service. It can get very busy at times but you rarely have to wait too long to be served at the bar.   Prices are competitive for a city centre pub and an excellent selection of beers and spirits are on offer.   The pub is predominantly a drinking establishment so there is little food on offer - crisps and nuts are available, along with pies.   The pub has two large screen TVs and football and rugby are often shown, attracting large crowds. The lounge area has some rugby memorabilia on the wall and there tends to be a crowd of supporters in the pub when there are rugby tournaments being played at Murrayfield.   This is a pub best suited to an older crowd as there's no music and its really all about the ambience and the banter.   I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "This is a bar that looks as if it is not changed since the 70's a sort of old mans pub feel minus the old man. Even though a small bar they made plenty of room for three plasma tv's and each one with something different for every one. The darts, the cricket and the football shame it's not my cuppa l prefer the news.   Jukebox available no dartboard. But there is a puggy and some warm nuts that cost a fortune or pickled onion crisps.   Music is depressing would be advisable to only have one drink here before going elsewhere.",

    "text": "Robertson's 37 Bar is a bit of an unusual pub, having retained a very old fashioned air, despite the fact that it's on Rose Street, in the city centre surrounded by modern, up-and-coming bars. But I love this place for exactly that reason. It feels like it's been untouched for 50 years, but doesn't seem dirty or tired, it's more cosy and welcoming to me. They have a good selection of beers available and it's where the older generation still come to have a pint and gossip. They offer toasties, hot pies with beans and/or gravy if you'd like, and the food is available most of the day, although I've never been in after 5pm. There are a couple of really cosy little booths, and you will be able to sit and chat quietly in here, as there is no loud music to get in the way. The staff have been there forever, and some of them will perhaps come across as a little grumpy, or even bossy! But having been in here many times, I know that this isn't the True attitude, and it's just a result of running a pub damn well and coping with all that brings, they're actually great and we often have a good laugh! A firm favourite for me - in fact, I think I'm overdue a visit!",
