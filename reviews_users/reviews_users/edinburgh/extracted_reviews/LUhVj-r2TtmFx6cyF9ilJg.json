    "text": "I actually quite liked this place. It's not fancy, kinda looks like it's been decorated by ikea, however for the concept of quick tapas style Indian street food you wouldn't really expect a plush decor.   I came with a group of 10, organised by me (again) to try somewhere new around the Lothian rd area and of course for their byob policy. Always a winner at a team night out!   I wasn't sure how the menu and concept would go down for such a large group. The waiter's suggestion of some set options for a per head cost were poo-poo'd by the blokes who wanted \"their own food\" so I had to ask for a bit of paper to write down everyone's 3 choices against their names so we could remember what we ordered and keep track. Complicated or what! The waiters were pretty patient with us thankfully.   The food turned up at different times. Basically it arrived when it was ready. I explained the concept of the place to the guys a million times but there were a few moans from people who didn't have their food when some had 2 dishes. The moans stopped when everyone had at least 1 of their dishes in front of them.   The quality of the food was unquestionable though. Very tasty! I had mixed pakora (half of it sneakily nicked by a work buddy), butter chicken and a lamb dish with ginger. The lamb was my favourite! The selection of naan breads were great - soft, buttery, crispy.... No-one had any complaints with the food. The only options that didn't go down as well as the others were the mini Indian burgers (well, what do you expect ordering a burger in an Indian restaurant!) and some kind of cold chickpea mush on crisp things. The 2 people who ordered that option both didn't expect it to be a cold dish and felt the menu description was completely different to what arrived.   I'd go back again but in a much smaller group. It's far too complicated keeping track of dishes for large parties. My control freak tendencies were pushed to the limit on this visit.   P.s. nice, clean toilets! With toothbrushes...!?!?!",

    "text": "Tuk Tuk is fresh, bright and new, offering a street food spin on Indian food. Essentially, what they have on offer is tapas style Indian, so it's not a style with which you'll be entirely unfamiliar. It's early days for the place, and I don't feel they've really found a range of dishes that will wow customers, but they're starting from a solid foundation, so have every chance to develop into a really good wee place.  Overall, we said: \"Tuk Tuk is worth a visit, but I'd be surprised if you're blown away by what they have on offer. The idea is a good one, but the quality and/or originality needs to be cranked up a notch if the place is going to put broad grins on the faces of diners. For now, it's quietly pleasing, which is quite a good starting point. I look forward to visiting, later in the year, to see how the menu has evolved and how they've developed their offering.\"",

    "text": "Sitting on a prominent corner opposite the Kings Theatre, Tuk Tuk Indian Street Food is an odd mix of modern minimalist marketing and traditional simple street food.  It works on a tapas-style approach - they recommend two people order between 5 and 6 dishes and work from there. It's not licensed so BYOB is the order of the day (no corkage charge),  So, last night, when I was the lead guitarist out of the Shadows, we decided to pop in here after picking up a rather nice bottle of red on the way. When it comes to tapas, I come over all Carol Vorderman and select random dishes from different sections without much attention to what's actually in them.  Sometimes it works and sometimes my food allergies get the better of me. On this occasion I think it's safe to say it worked out reasonably well.   We had......  Fish cakes.  Not that great. Yes they were shaped like cakes and had an 'aroma de la mer' but somehow the subtle flavours were lost amidst the rest.  They would have benefited from some kind of dipping sauce. They weren't that hot either.  Lamb kebabs that could have done with a yoghurt dressing but otherwise were pretty decent. Chilli garlic chicken. Fantastic. A lamb curry. Almost as good as the chilli garlic chicken.  Hakka Chilli Paneer. Just confusing. Think Singapore Noodles meets Rogan Josh. It tasted ok but somehow my senses were working overtime to comprehend what I was seeing and what I was tasting.  On the side we had rice and garlic nan, both good.  We finished off with a couple of chai teas.   So in summary, I think Tuk Tuk is probably a decent 'try me' kind of place, but I don't think there's enough here to keep me coming back for more. Yes the bill is quite reasonable, but you've already paid for your booze and it's easy to leave that calculation off the total.  As with most tapas ventures there will inevitably be a couple of dishes that don't totally work so you have to focus on the overall appeal of the meal.",

    "text": "Controlling food spending but not managing to find a Pizza house to obtain a chickeny pizza with BBQ sauce base to scoff outdoors in the Meadows on a sunny day we found ourselves at Tuk Tuk.  First time here and had to ask if they were open as we entered there was no-one else in. After quizzing staff on this we found out the reason it was a sunny day and everyone would be in the Meadows eating sausages or pizza, but they were booked heavily for later on. So we had choice of any table, and had the whole restaurant to ourselves, it defo wasn't a crowded house.  Too warm to drink beer, which they don't  have anyway(only soft drinks), we were offered bottles of chilled still water, but had also brought our own bottle. A short time later, some food arrived, so found out the washrooms were downstairs, knowing when I got back the remainder of food would be there.   Venturing into the basement was like there had previously been the perfectly cool wine cellar or old bank with plenty places to store that precious metal or paper currency?  There was three of us at Leven Street's Tuk Tuk, and they managed to satisfy our hunger pangs with lots of small variations of lamb and chickeny portions such as Chook Lollipops(tandoori style), Butter Chooks, Bun Chook Kebabs with salad leafs and Patina Lamb, that were all complimented with a variety of spicy & mint dips, in addition to rice and fries.  To give them four possibly five stars would be for creating an golden authentic styled establishment, not bowing to an inclusive mixture of other cuisines; seven dam-fine flavours and cost for three happy excited campers 25-ish.  The place is bright and quite comfortable to plant your derriere, and has Bollywood styled music to complete that Indian feeling, but simply another great 2 month old toddler that Tollcross has to offered the good folks of Edinburgh...makes me start to wonder is this now the gastronomic area of the city?  See ya soon Tuk Tuk, for another great afternoon!?",

Busy, buzzing atmosphere was great in this BYOB spot. A few pointers:  - MUST GET: Butter Chicken - Steer clear: Saag paneer - never has paneer been so salty and saag just like wilted spinach - BYOB: There is an off license just a few doors down on the side street. Basic beer and very basic wine selection. - Tapas = small plates. All of the selections are pretty small. We had the following and were full:  Mumbai Burgers (one burger), Samosas, Chutney, pappadom (x2), Kurkure, Sag paneer (again, skip it), raste ke biryani, butter chicken, peshwari naan, garlic naan.",

    "text": "Choas.  Firstly when we arrived it was unclear whether we should wait to be seated or just sit down where there was a table available. We decided to wait to be seated..whilst we waited several frantic members of staff rushed by us without acknowledging we were there. During our wait one member of staff brought us a bill, we hadn't even seen a menu! So we were seated, and given some menus, our order was taken and our food came very quickly (less than 10 minutes after we ordered) and before our drinks. The food was very good, very tasty and great for sharing.  The main reason why I only gave it three stars was the service. This place obviously lacks structure and organisation. It was all very chaotic and each member of staff seemed to be rushing about but not doing very much (tables were left uncleared for a long time). It was quite busy so was very noisey when we arrived, which in turn gave me a headache and made it quite difficult to hold a conversation.  I would like to go back, and I really hope the second time that the service meets the standards of the food, if it doesn't I don't think I will return a third time.  P.S This place is a B.Y.O.B and have a very limited soft drinks menu so even if you aren't drinking I'd recommend taking your own saft drinks.",

    "text": "So, I sort of feel bad to review this restaurant this early, as others have mentioned how they've only opened recently and are working out the kinks. My friend and I went here for dinner after work on a Thursday about 2 weeks after opening and were very excited to come here after seeing the restaurant's tuk tuks wandering the streets. First of all, it's a great location in the heart of tollcross, across from King's Theatre and conveniently next to a co-op when you want to take advantage of Tuk Tuk's BYOB policy. The branding they've developed is very smart and makes it look like it's part of a chain. After asking one of the waitstaff who is a school friend of the owner, he said they hope to eventually expand in this way. The interior is very stylish but also has an old building charm. We only discovered upon visiting the toilets that the building must have used to be a bank, as there's a huge vault door in the ladies'! The music was also very fun, who doesn't love a bit of bollywood?  The major problem with our visit was the wait for the food. We were seated immediately when we arrived, but because there was a large group that had sat down not long before us, the kitchen had a hard time dealing with the number of orders. Our server continually apologised for the delay and even brought out complementary poppadoms when we asked for something because we were starving after waiting for such a long time. I would think that once they have their service down, they would aim to bring out the tapas style dishes as they're ready, but we mostly got ours all at once as in a normal restaurant. The food was good. Each dish came in a perfect portion size considering one person is recommended to order 2-3 dishes. There was this mysterious sauce that seemed to appear drizzled on most of the dishes; my friend didn't much care for it but it wasn't listed on the menu so she didn't know not to ask for it. The dishes also came in these small metal dishes that, while stylish, were very hot to the touch! It made it difficult if you wanted to pour a curry over rice or to pass a dish over the table to someone. At the end of the meal, though, the bill was surprisingly affordable for the amount we ordered, though at that time they could only take cash as payment. Luckily, it's located right next to the co-op! I plan on going back here because I think they have a lot of potential and room to improve on this one experience. I'm excited to see this local business grow, hopefully for the better.",

    "text": "Seriously underwhelmed :/  which is sad because last year we really enjoyed it here! I felt like they had changed the menu a bit, seemed less street foodie and more like normal Indian dishes you could get anywhere but in smaller portions .  I will say I really enjoyed the Mumbai burger (vegetable) and the Bombay chilli chicken .   Majorly disappointed in the chicken korma which just tasted like chicken cooked separately and then placed in some yellow coloured coconut cream :/  the chicken lollipops were just plain fried drum sticks couldn't taste any extra spice. The channa puri had a nice sauce with its chickpeas, but the deep fried flat bread was so deep fried that no one in our party found it worth eating  because all you taste is oil.   Then service was meh, not very attentive especially when the place was so empty . And the weirdest part is the place smells sterile not a hint of food :/ Indian spices should be filling this place !   Supper disappointed .Still three stars because I liked  two of the dishes so I imagine there are more on the menu that are good... But I won't be the one coming back to try and find them .",

As we were going to the cinema at Fountainpark in the afternoon we decided to go here after. I totally forgot to take a photo of the food (sorry Robyn) but it looked as good as it tasted.  This super informal restaurant is home to a lovely chilled environment with nice staff and great food. What more could you ask for? Also, it is BYOB with free corkage, so nip next door to Scotmid, grab a cheapy bottle of wine and settle in Tuk Tuk for the evening.  The menu contains a vast array of authentic Indian street food dishes. We order about 8 dishes to share between us, including lamb, veg and chicken, accompanied by a couple of delicious cheese naans and a roti. I can't remember the exact dishes we ordered but everything was so full of flavour and tasty, I would recommend going there and just ordering a variety of dishes that you have no idea what they are.  My only criticism (and why I haven't given it 5 stars) was that the food wasn't hot (temperature), it was all pretty luke warm. However, this is easily fixed and I'm sure we'll be back there again very soon. Highly recommend it!",

    "text": "Great restaurant with funky decor and enough talking points to keep the most hard-pressed for conversation diners occupied.  Staff were a little off. 1 chap wasn't sure what each dish was, unable to answer questions we posed. Another girl seemed to forget she'd handed us a menu for further orders, prompting us to get her attention. So a bit lax in that respect.  But the fact we wanted to order more says a lot about the place. The food is damn tasty. Set out in a tapas-style fare, Tuk Tuk recommends a good 3 or 4 dishes per person so as to get a wide feel for the menu. Although they don't offer much in the way of seafood, the chicken, lamb and veggie dishes they produce are flavoursome and plentiful.  I forget the names, and as the website is currently down am unable to blag it, but I would particularly recommend the chicken on the bone, cooked in lime and pickle. And the wee veggie parcels that, as the menu says, need to be tasted to be believed.  And such good value. We must've nailed a good 8 dishes, on top of that a roti and 2 naans, to receive a bill to the tune of 40. The fact they are BYoB (and don't charge for corkage) is a massive help in this area.  I will certainly be back. Thursday Curry Club will want to know of this place. And I recommend you go too. NOW!",

    "text": "Tuk Tuk really feels like a solid four stars, no quibbling about the rating.  After a day wandering around Marchmont, Bruntsfield and Morningside we wanted something quick and tasty to eat before heading back to our Leith abode.  I remembered Tuk Tuk and off we went.  It was fairly quiet, but not dead, so we were served quickly.  After pouring over the menu we settled on pakora, Sag Paneer, Chicken Achari (the lime and pickle chicken on the bone), Railway Station Lamb (lamb on the bone with spinach), poppadoms, naan and rice.  In hindsight, I probably should have added another dish or two, as I was still pretty hungry, but oh what a wonderful thing hindsight is!  The pakora wasn't really pakora, or at least not like any I'd had before.  It was more deep fried slices of vegetable... oh well.  Poppadoms and pickles were good (I love lime pickle), but the condiments did come in tiny jars.  The naan was similarly fine. Honestly the only bit I was less keen on was the Sag Paneer, it was just too liquidy and flavourless.  Which is a shame, as I really like both spinach and paneer cheese!  The rest of the food made up for it though - the lamb was tasty, and the chicken was delicious.  Really, order the chicken.  Its colour is rather luminous (bright pink) but it tasted blimming good.  If I were to return I'd definitely order it again.  We didn't experience any of the service issues that other reviews have mentioned, but this is possibly because we visited at about 8pm on a Sunday.  The decor was fun, and there was an interesting variety of food, not just the usual curry house suspects.  Is Tuk Tuk amazing, or worth going out of your way for?  Probably not, but if you're in the area you should give it a go.",

    "text": "The last time I visited Tuk Tuk, I was really impressed. The food was fresh and tasty, and the concept of tapas-style Indian food was a novel concept for me. The place was buzzing and it felt like I'd been temporarily transported from the bitter cold of Edinburgh to a Bollywood film set in Mumbai. So I was quite excited to return for a second visit. Alas, I was a bit disappointed.  On my second trip, we made the mistake of not booking beforehand and so had to wait for a while (15 mins) before a table was free. We were asked to take a seat in a little room off the main restaurant, where there was another couple waiting. Unfortunately, more people were invited into the room and it became a bit claustrophobic, however we were offered water and menus whilst we waited.   We were shown to our table, one of the canteen-style long benches. And then it was as if we were forgotten about. No-one came to take our order, and it was only after I signalled to one of the waiters that we were given attention. I got the impression that there were a few senior staff who were stressed at having to manage the less experienced staff. There seemed to be a lot of staff running around, which does on one hand add to the street-food experience the restaurant is trying to offer, but came across as being a bit disorganised.   Tuk Tuk operates on the basis of first-cooked, first-served, so our dishes trickled out over the course of ten minutes. Unfortunately, they forgot about the mango lassi I ordered and I only received this nearer the end of the meal. We also had to remind staff about our Indian 'snack pot' that never arrived.   The food itself, though, is great. The butter chicken I ordered trumped any prior tikka massala I've tried and the Chicken 69 (basically chicken nuggets in a sweet sauce) was pretty tasty. My selection of vegetable pakoras were pretty good too. The mango lassi was worth the wait. My only complaint food-wise was that the rice portions are a bit conservative (or maybe that's just compared to the load of rice normally served in takeaways).   Overall, we were 20 each for around 9 dishes, 2 rice and a naan (and those Indian snacks). Staff were generally friendly but flustered. Still, I'll probably go again, if only for another dose of that butter chicken.",

Can't quite figure out who they're aiming at though, as the times I've been it's been a real mix of quite big groups and tables of 2/4 so the atmosphere can feel a bit harsh. It's BYOB and don't recall getting charged corkage, but that could have been their mistake. Food is ok but would say it's 50/50 in that some dishes were full of flavour but others were just average. Service isn't bad at all and it looks the part, although when not busy can seem a bit empty shanty town, but there's just something missing about the place. Not suggesting it should be a full on Danny Boyle extravaganza but for me street food has a real gutsy heart and here just seems a little bit too restrained.",

    "text": "Had to wait FOREVER to get fed here, which didn't do much for my grumbly and unreliable tummy. The other problem for me is that most of the food is spicy, which is a bit of an issue when you've got a sensitive gut like me (too much info?). Despite asking the waitress for the least spicy options, what turned up still had me sweating.   I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant and the idea of street food. We were in a group of nine people so quite a few folk ordered the set menu, which was never ending and seemed pretty good value for money. Again, quite long waits between servings so not an ideal option if the place is really busy.   I opted for two veggie dishes and a naan bread - I think one of the dishes was a daal and the other was a potato and aubergine dish. They were both nice, but the spice was too much for me despite the waitress saying they weren't too hot. What can I say, I'm a wimp. The portion sizes weren't spectacular as you'd expect from a joint that does Indian tapas, and that combo just about filled me up.   It was all just, well, okay. I see quite a lot of folk like this place, but the combo of spice, long wait and tapas didn't really do it for me. Maybe another visit needs to happen when less packed... Or maybe it's just not for me. TOO MUCH SPICY SPICY!! :(",

    "text": "I have been thinking about heading to the recently opened Tuk Tuk on Lothian Road for quite a while. I had heard rumours they would come and pick you up in the Tuk Tuk if you asked nicely too!  The idea behind it is that it is more of a street food rather than your usual curry experience. There are lots of small dishes that you can chose from and enjoy a tapas style sharing dinner (They suggest ordering 3 to 4 of the small dishes per person - perfect for sharing). I really like the laid back decor and Bollywood posters, plus the music is great to. It has a very happy chatty atmosphere to it which creates the right feelings for our [celebration meal.  We were all pretty hungry before entering the restaurant, and the delicious smells that hit us as we walked in meant we couldn't wait to sit down and order. To start we decided to share the Chicken Lollipops and samosas. The spiced wings are served on the bone and the coating of Keralan spices on the beautifully crisp exterior complimented the beautifully tender meat on the inside. The samosas were good but I much prefer the bigger ones you get from the indian shops as they have more filling! It was still a flavourful, moreish starter, leaving us excited for what was to come.  We ordered the Tandoori meat selection which comprised of lots of MEAT! It's a bit more expensive at about 12 I think but has different cuts of lamb and chicken all very well cooked and really nicely seasoned which went well with our other dishes including the Chole Frankie - a wrap filled with spiced chickpeas, herbs, pickled vegetables and chutney and the Sag Paneer - creamy spinach and cubes of home-made cottage cheese. I always order this dish everywhere we have an indian and this was one of the best I have had.   We accompanied our dishes with Pilau rice, peshwari nan and our own BYOB bottles of beer and wine. By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed and very happy! The staff were really friendly and just left us to chat - we ended up staying almost an hour after our meal without realising.  I think Tuk Tuk definitely scores highly for good food and laid-back dining, I would highly recommend it.",

Contemporary decor with lots of asian twists in the theme caught my interest from the outset. Really nice roomy space with lots of seating options from tables to massive benches. The menu is mainly tapas with options galore for veggies and vegans too, so thumbs up from the better half. I opted for the mixed grill and dare I say it this was better than the Kebab Mahal mixed grill that was my previous bench mark. I managed to try some of the paneer noodles, which were really tasty as were the mixed pickle jars.These are tiny little jars but packed full of flavour. All in the 3 of us had a great meal and will be back :D   Ahh yes a side note it is BYOB so if you fancy some vino with your Pakora make sure to grab some before you turn up, if not there is a COOP and a supermarket close at hand.",

    "text": "I have been eyeing this restaurant up for ages and finally got the chance to go last night and it was amazing!  Such a good selection of small Indian tapas plates ranging from 3.80-4.90 and everything we had was delicious. They suggested between 3-4 plates per person but myself and my friend had 6 between us and we were stuffed! We shared the butter chicken (so tasty), the fishcakes, somosas, kebab buns (like little burgers), Garlic chicken and Aubergine and potato and everything just tasted wonderful, such good quality and tasty food.  The restaurant is BYOB as well, on wine and beer, so is great for a bigger group as will keep the costs for dinner down. They also cater for larger groups, when we were in there was a large group of 20 and there was plenty of room. The restaurant is large too and really well spaced out - the decor is quirky with large wooden tables and wire lampshades so it does remind you of grabbing a quick bite in an Indian train station, which I loved. They also have Bollywood posters on the walls and Indian music playing, making the whole experience that bit more inclusive - you could forget for a minute that you were at the top of Tollcross!  The staff were also really friendly too.   This is definitely a new favourite of mine and I have been raving about it to everyone since last night. Tasty food, great choice and lovely surroundings go!",

No sodas or juice. Don't disrespect this awesome establishment!!  Food was great. We ordered butter and ginger chicken.  Can't go wrong with either.  Get both.  Chicken Biryani and lentils we also great but we were too full to enjoy them.    Note: plates are small.  They recommend 3 dishes per person but that's WAY too much still.  2 max.  You have to order the Pappadom. It's so cheap and doesn't fill you up it's just a sample of yumminess of what's to come.  Caution: Chili Cheese Naan is spicy. In America, Chili Cheese means something else. My wee sister ordered it, silly American, and was rightfully punished.  Go garlic. Not too garlicky. Just right.    Hopefully you'll read a few of the BYOB comments and bring some booze.  Grocery stores near by.   Go here!",

Unfortunately not sure if is what we ordered, but our experience was far from authentic. The decor and service were all good but the food was lacking!   We ordered a couple of tandoori rotis, some aloo gobi, dal makhni, and we got sticky toffee pudding for dessert.   First off, portion sizes are pretty small but they do recommend ordering 3 curries per person (pricey). We weren't too hungry so the amount we ordered was good. When we tried asking for onions/Mirch on the side they were going to charge us or if we asked for a Togo order they would charge us for plates.  The aloo gobi had literally one cauliflower and the rest was just potato :( the dal was good and roti was a little too crispy for me but it was all pretty average. The biggest disappointment was the sticky toffee pudding (shouldn't have ordered from an Indian place) which was dry and had no toffee. Best dish: pakoras! Highly recommend the eggplant one!",

The plates are small, but great for sharing, so everyone orders a few dishes and they get passed around. I ordered the samosas, butter chicken and aloo gobi and all three were tasty. I also tasted a bunch of items that others had ordered, but don't know the exact names, but there was a daal and a few other curries, and all were good.

It was approaching the time where our minutes were numbered and we'd have to make a move. Conveniently, Tuk Tuk was seconds away and, so, we obliged.  I love that it was tapas style, allowing you to try several dishes. Every little morsel was bursting with flavour, and I loved everything I ordered. Although, I'm totally in love with the mango lassi and I really wish I'd ordered the traditional lassi here as opposed to getting all experimental and tying the coconut kind. - It lacked the thickness of the mango variety. I may try the pistachio one next time. I had an AMAZING pistachio lassi at a fabulous little Indian restaurant in Italy. Such sweet, sweet memories of that delicious concoction. I would love to relive them in Edinburgh. I've noticed they do a lassi lunch time deal. - It would be rude not to!  The restaurant felt like a canteen because, despite the time, it was packed out and LOUD. Although, it was a little hard to hear over the constant chatter. There isn't really much Tuk Tuk can do about that though. The restaurant is thriving, and it's definitely well deserved. Service was the sweetest; so genuine and lovely. - I'd love to visit again soon!",

    "text": "Street food is that genre of cuisine that truly originates from a culture and its people. When I saw that a place like this existed in Edinburgh, I became very excited.   Set up in an old bank, Tuk Tuk (named for the unique Indian taxi/car) brings the cuisine of Indian Street food to your table and your taste-buds in style.  Its all tapas style (and they let you know that). Small plates that let you experience a great deal of different tastes. Correction different, amazing tastes. Their menu is extensive and sure to satisfy. It is incredible how much flavor their dishes have. Their varieties of naan serve as great sides to the dishes.  Its BYOB! No longer will you have to pay as much as a 6-pack for one beer. Its a great policy.   The service is friendly and informative, but it took a bit longer than most places for us to get our food especially considering we were a two-top. At the time that we went there was only one large family and us, so maybe it was strange timing or something. I imagine that is the drawback to tapas with a cuisine that typically takes time. Regardless, it is well worth the wait. Food comes out hot and as soon as its ready, so you might get it in waves of mini-courses.   Tip: They cater well to groups of 4 or more!: you can use the set menu to have a fixed price, and I saw something about rolling a die once, and if you predict the number right you get a meal free! (Only on certain days)  Tuk Tuk brings you more than food, it brings you atmosphere and genuine culture. Go on and get it.",

Been there already three times since i moved here and it is really some delicious indian tapas; i had a chance to try a whole bunch of then and as per usual, my favourite is the butter chicken but everything i have tried there has been delicious; my favourites naan is the one with coconut in it (cant recall the name)  and you should definitely give it a try! If you are a big eater, might want 2/3 plates but i usually take the butter chicken, naan and rice and it is usually enough for one but i usually take one more thing just to try something different! The staff is very nice and helpful; I would definitely recommend this place!  Fyi on monday, they have this thing where they make you roll the dice and if you roll a 6, your meal is free :)",

Finally, we found ourselves in the area, looking for food before a Fringe show, and I took the opportunity to rush towards Tuk Tuk. Turns out everyone else had the same idea too, and the place was heaving. However, we were promised a table in 10mins, and ushered to the 'bar' area. Bemusedly, we were shown into what appeared to be a storage area full of tins of chickpeas and other dry goods, and a spare chair. Sitting down, the SR leaned over, suggesting 'this may take longer than 10mins' as we stared out into the busy dining area.   keeping myself amused, I started to check out the goods around me, thinking idly it would be very easy to nip out with a tin of chick peas and mango puree, when my gaze dropped to the floor. As I am a crazy hamster owner, my brain started to wonder why there were hamster poops all over the floor, then logic kicked in.... and we shot straight out of dodge.   I guess - it's one thing for a restuarant to be infested with mice and you don't see it - it's another to be surrounded by it. This definitely goes under the header 'Avoid'.",

    "text": "It's being your own wine and/or beer with no corkage!!! The Indian food here is great, and I really enjoy the atmosphere!   They say that every person should order 3-4 dishes but I think that's cray-cray. Two is enough for me.  There's a youthful atmosphere that I like about this place. It's clean, airy, with fun bright orange colours. So very different to what I normally experience at other Indian restaurants (all of them I'm not bothered to sit in!)  The food tastes fresh! I ordered the railway station lamb and it came in it's own mini-pot with an abundance of spinach in the sauce. I thought that was a nice change. Generally when you order a curry it mentions things like peppers, spinach, etc, but you never ACTUALLY see much of vegetables in it.. It's mostly just overly oily/creamy sauce!   My group bought a few bottles of wine to bring, and once our table was cleared, we kept on drinking! What was nice is that we never felt rushed to leave after we finished eating. It felt like we stayed an extra hour afterwards and they didn't mind at all...  Anyways, I know when I want an Indian I will be here.

    "text": "Tuk Tuk Indian Street food has been on my radar for quite some time. I popped in last year for some samosas before the theatre, though could hardly review my experience here after not having sampled much from the menu.  I returned last night with my mum after an evening at the Cameo cinema for a light supper. We immediately observed how busy Tuk Tuk was, how noisy (many people were jolly thanks to a bit of Saturday night indulgence, there is a BYOB policy so hardly surprising) and yet how accomodating the staff were. Despite every table being occupied we only waited 5 minutes before a table was magically prepared for us.   I like the concept and style of this place. It is like Indian tapas, you choose small tasting dishes which are inspired by Indian street food. A little different from the typically British Tikka masala. The interior is cool and casual with ample seating for many diners.   We opted for a few taster dishes, amongst which we had paneer with mushrooms, tarka dahl and saag paneer with steamed rice. All were very flavoursome with enough spice. Service was fast and friendly, especially given how busy the restaurant was. There were some other interesting and seemingly authentic offerings though we just weren't hungry enough. The Lychee lassie option sounded interesting too.  I would come back if in need of a quick and tasty lunch/dinner.",

There's something highly intriguing about having a dish you've never tried served in a 'road worn' pot whilst enjoying your BYO Cobra.   Service tends to be attentive yet energetic/frantic as they keep up the orders flying in. Take a trip, get on the Tuk Tuk.",

    "text": "I had to add to my already good review, that Tuk Tuk still delivers as an excellent place to grab Indian food. We went after a movie and were nicely given a table for an hour (without a reservation). Again, we ordered far too much food, all was delicious and all of the dishes are devoid of that oiliness that you can often find at some Indian places. I would recommend this for dinner anytime!  I cycle past this place twice a day and thought it was time to give it a go. I got a same day reservation on a Saturday with short notice, so that was a plus and when we arrived, we waited maybe 3 minutes for our table. The staff was lovely, and despite being nearly full and very busy, it was still quite relaxed. The most important thing to know is it is BYO! The menu has plenty of options and is definitely a place for those who love to share food and try lots of things! As a veggie, I was pleased with the many delicious options available. We ordered quite a lot, starting with #24, which was these little baked pastries, you pour sauce into until it drips out and then pop into your mouth. It was a cold-ish dish and was nice, light and flavorsome.  I got the baby aubergine and potato #16, as well as the slow cooked lentils and kidney beans #28 and #19, with okra. My boyfriend for the mutton on the bone, #35 and I can't remember the other. All with plenty of rice and naan. The food arrived quickly and each was pipping hot and all yum! The only minor thing for me is wanting a bit more spice, but that is more my preference and each dish was tasty, not too oily or heavy and well cooked. I couldn't get over how nice the potatoes tastes, they had such a lovely and almost sweet flavor. Whether they were just the potatoes themselves or the sauce they were cooked in, I was very happy.  This is the first Indian food restaurant I've been pleased with in Edinburgh, and although maybe a bit more trendy, it was lovely. Our whole meal came to 30, which was worth it for quality of food and nice service we got. I forgot to bring wine, but next time I won't forget and I would certainly recommend this for a date or for a group! Definitely a hands on, sharing meal.",

    "text": "We went to tuk tuk following an evening fringe show and were surprised to see how many people were still there given it was past 10! Sadly the kitchen was closing at 1030 and so we were slightly rushed in going through the extensive menu on which a lot of the dishes were tempting!  We ended up getting: - lamb curry with a mint base (patina?) which was the highlight of our dinner, great flavour and really well cooked lamb, good portion for 2 to share along with other dishes - chilli chicken which again was really well flavoured although a little spicy for me - biryani; well-cooked chicken on the bone, and really well flavoured rice - gilafi kebab: I really liked this though my better half didn't. Accompanied with an interesting dip - fish cakes: good flavour, portion for 1 or 2 to share  - naans which were perfectly cooked  All in all, a good meal with all the dishes having real authentic flavours. Add to that, the decor is quite unique, making it a real good option for a dinner with friends (not to mention that that would allow you to sample more dishes!) which won't leave too big a hole in your wallet. As you may have noted from my descriptions above, the portions for the curries and biryani are generous and so you might be best of starting with an order of 2 per person (rather than the 3-4 they recommend) and order more later if you need.",
