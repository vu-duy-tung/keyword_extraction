It's yet another family owned Italian restaurant; I used to wonder how they ever broke even with all this competition but they are businesses at the end of the day so I'll believe they know what they're doing!  The menu consists of the usual anti pasti, soups, pasta, veal, beef and sea food but I was really excited by the pizza prices, which makes it hard to justify ordering Dominoes when I could get an authentic Italian pizza for 7!",

    "text": "This place is like a much, MUCH better version of Bar Napoli. As in, they haven't just been fined for various health and safety breaches but they still retain that friendly, down-to-earth, authentic feel to it. Alongside all the many overpriced eateries on or around George Street, this place is a breath of fresh air.  But there were a few things that niggled me when I ate in here recently. Nothing huge, but things like the fact that they cram in too many tables, so you're constantly eavesdropping on other people's conversations whether you like it or not. And when it's not busy, the fact that there are so many tables means that you're overly aware of the fact that there's hardly anyone else ther. Not really great for the atmosphere of it.  Rant over, this is still a good value Italian in a really convenient location. Although it lacks some of the charm of the sister branch on Cockburn Street, it's still worth trying.",

    "text": "Sometimes, all you want on an afternoon of heavy duty shopping is a cheap and cheerful, filling lunch, and La Rusticana's business lunch deal ticks all the right boxes.  My mum and I went here for a last minute bite before the train home, and we were pleasantly surprised at the 5.45 lunch menu. Three courses, for under 5.50! Almost unheard of in the big City.  The restaurant itself is nice enough. It's in a strange place, kind of underneath shops, which makes it very inconspicuous, but inside, it is very cosy and homely, with artexed walls and a very old taverna feel, which I absolutely love. It gives the place a very traditional feel, unlike DiMaggio's or Bella Italia. I would certainly choose this place over either of them any day. The Italian opera music really gave it that extra shove right into Little Italy.  I have to be honest and say I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. I mean, what can you get for under 6 nowadays? I browsed the lunch menu and found more than one thing per course that I would happily eat, which is a novelty for me when ordering from a set menu. I decided on the Minestrone soup,  Pollo Cacciatore and amaretto gateaux for desert.   The soup was lovely, piping hot and in quite a large bowl, served with a lump of crusty bread. The main, Chicken Cacciatore was delicious, the tomato and olive sauce with peppers and mushrooms was rich and tangy, and the chunks of chicken were cooked to complete perfection.  My favourite tipple is amaretto, so I was incredibly excited about the desert. I wasn't disappointed, and it was sooo strong! Absolutely delicious, with a splash of cream. I can honestly say I was stuffed full, and could not believe the meal we had just had for the price. Outstanding.  I can't recommend this place enough. Perhaps not the absolute best Italian feast I have ever had, but most certainly one of them, and most definitely the best value!",

    "text": "Second visit to this restaurant. First visit was a little underwhelming but I was willing to give it a second chance. Wrong. They were busy enough and they have many 'regular' visitors that are being treated as family. This enthusiasm was however not reserved for our group of 9. Our table (like the first time) was crammed and our number 9 seat was squeezed at the end. Service is on a familiar basis and a little too much on the miss side an lesser on the hit side. Granted our payable drinks were served promptly, but we had request jugs of water twice before they were actually served.  The starter I took was the prosciutto and melon - the melon was tough. The prosciutto was very good. Main course was Spag Carbonara - to which I added mushrooms and that was made very well and good and creamy - I really enjoyed that! Once that was finished we waited - table cleared and.. waited. Until one of our group requested a dessert menu from a flyby waiter. no no no .. we should be offered not asked for! - I ordered a banasplit (as you don't get that very often these days) in my experience a banana split is vanilla ice cream, nuts, banana and chocolate sauce. - or if you will a dame blanche with banana. Anyhow.. we were served a very colourful plate of 3 different flavoured ice-creams (vanilla, strawberry, chocolate) - some green colouring and a variety of fruits that DO NOT BELONG in a banana split. I did not ask for figs, kiwis, pineapple nor green apple. This is NOT a fruit punch cocktail. Coffee was served but no cookie or chocolates. (which we did got the first time I was there - so no consistency. In the meanwhile the place was packing up and somehow we were left, forgotten? Several times we requested the bill which eventually came. Nice of them to separate food & drinks - made the calculations easier.   I have now vowed not to go there any time soon, as for the monies paid I could have had a much better experience in another establishment",

I get the feeling it is in their contract.   The Pizza is nothing like what you can find in Italy and the tomato sauce is about as bland as a milky Cafe Latte... but like I said, a safe bet if you just want to eat something when you're out in town.   I've still to find a decent Italian in Edinburgh... so hoping TrustedPlaces will bring something to my attention.",
