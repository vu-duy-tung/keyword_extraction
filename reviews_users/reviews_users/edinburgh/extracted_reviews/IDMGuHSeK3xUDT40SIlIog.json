Ten minutes after our tea and coffee were served (best coffee in over two weeks), we were told the chef was in a good mood and would take our orders early. We ordered eggs and bacon as well as the lamb hash. Both were delicious. Our server came over twice to make sure we were satisfied during the meal. The decor and overall setting were comfortable.",

The flavours were creative but most importantly I have never had better poached eggs ever. They were perfection.   Staff were nice if a little distant, and despite the odd time of day you could tell the atmosphere would be a good one. They even had a little box of toys in the corner! Win.",

It was okay, but I think chorizo is maybe just not my thing. Plenty of other great items on the menu, so we'll continue to work our way through!   Also, second time in a row they provided water for my dog, Buddy, without having to ask! Lovely! Massive improvements in service!",

    "text": "We love doing brunch and Ostara really did not disappoint. Ostara is a new edition to Leith and if they keep up the quality of food and innovative menu they are on course to be one of the best brunch spots in Edinburgh. The menu is healthy, creative and reminds me of brunch menus that you only see in the USA and Australia. I had mixed chilli bean on toast with poached eggs (cooked to perfection) and a side of puddledub sausages. The other half had Avocado smash on homemade bread with feta, chilli and tomatoes. Finally, Ostara benefits from space and you can actually get a private seat without someone ear-wigging into your conversation which is a rarity in Edinburgh. Also next to the Water of Leith its the perfect pitstop for a day out.  We will definitely be back!!!",

It is a charming little place with wonderful coffee and teas. You can not go wrong in whatever you order. I can only speak for their breakfast; however, from the homemade desserts they showed us I'm wishing we weren't leaving the city just so we could eat there again. Definitely worth the trip!",
