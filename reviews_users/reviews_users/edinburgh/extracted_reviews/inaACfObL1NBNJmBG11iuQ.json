They have a particularly tasty toasty ciabatta with salami and salsa it's delish.  The staff are friendly and the prices are very reasonably for absolutely outstanding goodies.",

I was told by the very friendly owner that the soup is his very own recipe. We also ordered a fresh carved chicken sandwich. The roll was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We will be back for another round. Yes...there is soup for you!",

It had a good ratio of cheese to sauce, and was nicely made as well :-)  The portion size was just the ticket for my appetite that day; Global has limited seating if you want to eat there, and a range of the usual wrap and bread options depending on what you're craving at the time.  Recommended!",

The deli is simply amazing - a huge range of things to choose from, and always full of returning customers who know how great this place really is.Panninis, rolls, sandwiches - they do it all, either choose from the menu or ask nicely and create your own. The food is always prepared infront of you, including the morning rolls that they do (sausages and bacon etc), so a feeling of freshness is always there.  The global Deli is a great place to grab a tasty, and fresh something to eat.",

    "text": "Ok so today my healthy normal eating habits are making a return, no more cakes or muffins for lunch!! So I decided a lovely sarnie should stop my tummy from rumbling through my usual 2 hour Monday lab session..... so now the main question was where does a good sandwich??! Dilemma.  I have passed this place a few times and immediately noticed the ridiculous bright green building and the sign outside advertising falafel.......... Yum for my tum!! So I decided to give it a go, I only had an hour between class and it is so close.  So basically I walked in and was amazed at the wide selection they have on offer.... and also stumped, what the frick do I have!?!? Then I saw it, smoked salmon and cream cheese - give me that bad boy right there! Plus they have a wide selection of rolls that you can choose from, and they are HUGE!! I was expecting it to be rather small as I was paying only 2.80, but no! I loved every mouthful of it, once I had removed the tomato and cucumber! But great for grabbing something cheap when you are in a rush.",

In hindsight, I should have perhaps tried more than the breakfast rolls before dishing out the scores, but after todays brie, bacon and guacamole toasted ciabatta, there's only one score to give. Utterly, utterly wonderful, and the thought of getting another tomorrow is actually making me look forward to going to work.  In a street with three fantastic sarnie / takeaway bars right next to each other, I wasn't initially sure if Global could compete. I stand corrected, it's the best of the lot.",

The guy making it said he would add in some extra;s, if I didn't mind. I battered my eyelids and blushed, of course not, handsome sandwich man with sexy accent!!  The only thing that puts me off Global is the location....I find it difficult to eat and walk, I prefer to sit down somewhere comfortable and enjoy my lunch, but being where it is I had to go find a bench. ok it wasn't difficult to find one, but kinda wish it was closer to my flat. Ok that's selfish, but handsome sandwich man had a VERY sexy accent.",

They do paninis, rolls and bagels with a great range of fillings. My favourite is the bacon, brie and cranberry, although everything is really tasty. You can also get hot drinks and fruit to accompany your lunch. Global is also a great place to grab a quick breakfast roll. They do all the usual (sausage, bacon, egg etc.) and cook it fresh in front of you so it's always piping hot. A good tasty treat to start the day.",
