Service was excellent! Everyone was friendly and helpful. I couldn't decide between the fish or paneer pakora. Our server suggested we do half and half. I love being able to have that option especially being generally indecisive and always wanting variety! It was the perfect option and the perfect amount of food for us. Each pakora dish also comes with a sauce. Again, our server suggested we try two different ones and he would give us half of a spicy sauce and half yogurt based and we were only charged for one sauce. Both pakoras were fantastic. Especially the fish, it was so flavourful. I highly recommend this place and wish that I could have more time in Edinburgh so I can come back and try more dishes here!",

The Pakora Bar serves fresh Indian food and specializes in an Indian batter used to fry all sorts of ingredients called pakora. We tried the pakora chicken and fish (5 pieces each plate which was a good amount). We also tried the fresh mango sauce and the punjab sauce (both are great choices). Both dishes were very good. The spices were great and the fish was very fresh. The staff was very helpful in explaining the menu and ingredients. All of this for a very affordable price. Will definitely come back to this new and upcoming restaurant!",

The staff in there were extremely friendly and nice, and explained all their efforts to ensure the food was suitable for vegetarians and people with gluten-intolerance. Despite their best efforts, there was a slight potential issue with cross-contamination, but they happily cooked some fresh pakora and samosas in new oil.   The food was delicious, with some terrific sauces. Don't go expecting a restaurant experience, as it's more of a street food cafe. However, if you like your food fresh, hot and tasty then this is a great location. No alcohol license yet, but they've made an application.",
