    "text": "Vittoria is an Edinburgh institution and one of the best Italians in the city. The food is delicious and reasonably priced with a wide selection of pizza, pasta and meat dishes,. The staff are extremely friendly and the service is some of the best I have encountered (for example, we once had to wait an extra 5 minutes for our main course due a mistake by the waitress. Even though we didn't mind and were happy to wait, we were given that dish for free and received an apology from the owner!). There are dishes to suit everyone and they even offer 'half pizza, half pasta' options if there are two of you. Great if you can't decide! Th restaurant also caters for children and is perfect for a family birthday lunch. Located near the top of Leith Walk, it's a great option for a meal before the cinema at the Omni or a show at the Playhouse. It's certainly better priced and better quality than most of the cluster of restaurants around the Playhouse and in the Omni centre.",

Vittoria seemed like the perfect choice: Italian food, relaxed atmosphere and opposite my flat, and in that respect I can't fault it. It was comfortable, not too noisy and the food was good.  You're unlikely to have a life-changing culinary experience here but that wasn't what I was looking for on this occasion. I had Polpette as a starter which is meatballs in a delicious tomato sauce and a Capricciosa pizza as a main which while not a very adventurous choice was just what I wanted. The pizza was very good, nice thin base, plenty of cheese and plenty of flavour. Also we had an excellent bottle of Valpolicella which was a lovely surprise. Vittoria does what it does very well. As Italian comfort food goes it's great. The food's tasty, the portions are generous and the staff are very attentive (probably crossing the line to a little over-friendly). I would definitely go again.",

Italian is one of my favourite cuisines and there is nothing worse than when restaurants do it badly.   I wasn't disappointed with this place. The food was fantastic, and even though we only had time to stop for a main course (Boo!), It was fab. The pizza Golfo (broccoli, salmon and King prawns) was a really unusual but absolutely delicious combination. I have never seen it on a menu before and I would specifically come back here to have it again. I managed to squeeze in a cheeky coffee made with amaretto for a very reasonable 2.80.  This may be in the running for one of my favourite Italians in the City!",

Every time we met he would ask me if I had been, I was beginning to think that they hired him for PR.  I'm going to say something controversial, but the food in Vittoria is better than what you get in Italy. Usually the first time I venture to a new Italian place,  I get Spaghetti Bolognese. Because lets face it, if they can't get the classics right, there is no hope.  The meat was fresh, the pasta wasn't overcooked and soggy and the sauce was nearly a sexual experience. The staff we're all really friendly too. This is a family run place so it feels like your guests in their kitchen and the service was amazingly fast.  Stop reading, just go.",

This could be True, however as I don't often go out to eat Italian food I don't have a lot to compare it to.   Vittoria is a family owned restaurant and I almost feel like I was reminded of this at every opportunity. Which is fair enough for them to be proud of their successful family business. The menu is your standard Italian of pizzas, pastas and meat dishes. I had a pizza which I really enjoyed, freshly made and crispy with the right amount of toppings- not too much and not too little. My boyfriend had a calzone which I was pretty jealous of. Huge in size and packed full of meat he inhaled it quite happily. Me being a pansy, little girl couldn't finish a whole pizza so they kindly boxed it up for me. Tasted just as good the next morning for breakfast.   The service was actually really good with friendly waiters and prompt service. I will most likely return here as it seems like a safe option for good, hearty Italian food.",

Mind you, I come from a place that's fairly awash with really good Italian, so it's a bit of a struggle to impress me in this arena. I like their pastas and they have good pizzas and nice salads. And I'll admit I haven't tried much else. The service has always been friendly.  The best thing here has to be sitting out front on a nice summer day. They have a large outside area positioned just right to get the afternoon sun, and when it's nice out it can be a terrific place for a glass of wine between friends. Inside (as has been previously noted) it's a bit tired, though I've seen far worse.  If you're in the neighbourhood and craving Italian, this would be the place I'd point you to.",

The restaurant is nice but caters for a lot of diners. Nevertheless you don't have to wait long for your food. When it does come, the presentation can leave a lot to be desired, the above pizzapasta comes crammed together on one plate for example.   Vittoria does the simple things well but if you are looking for a bit more culinery, it might be an idea to try another restaurant like La Concha.",

We ordered a meat/cheese platter for our starter which was extremely delicious and for mains we went half and half on pizza and pasta. Everything was absolutely delicious, particularly the fresh pasta and the portions by Edinburgh standards were absolutely huge. We were nearly stuffed after just our starter. Also have to mention that Vittoria is really child friendly which is incredibly important to us as we have a 4 month old daughter. The staff made a real fuss over her which she clearly loved and when we left one of the waiters helped us carry our pram down two steps within the restaurant. For this alone Vittoria's deserves 5 stars. Total price for a starter (for sharing), 2 mains, 2 cokes and a beer, 44. Not bad! Can't recommend enough, perhaps my new favourite restaurant in Edinburgh.",

We were seated without a reservation which was surprising and the maitre d was very welcoming.  For starters we had the Aracini and Panzanella salad. The Aracini were filled with bolognese and had a spicy tomatoes sauce.  They were perfectly fried and full of flavor.  Not a lot of spice but enough to cut through the fry.  The salad was an excellent version of the dish, with capers and peppers in addition to the standard bread, mozarella, and tomato.  It had an excellent balasamic and oils dressing. Our only suggestion was using a more flavorful tomatoe like a campari versus the beef steak.    The mains were chicken wrapped in ham and squid ink risotto with calamari.  Both dishes were excellent.  The chicken was moist and the ham added a depth of flavor.  The squid ink risotto was a perfect risotto which is even harder with squid ink so we were very impressed.  The squid was soft and perfectly prepared as well.  The flavors were complex and a blend between the sea and a slight level of spice/heat.  Very delicious.  In general the wait staff was good with our main waiter Manuel was very attentive and helpful. But one of the assistants was rude with us many of the tables. And some of the others were not as friendly, which was off putting at first but once Manuel took over things improved.   Overall, it was a great meal and we definitely recommend it.  Usually plan on reservations but you can try with out them and you may get lucky as well.",

Anyway, the service was prompt, and the menu was vast. The quality and taste was quite high to be honest, even though it's not your fancy gourmet restaurant. I loved the lunch specials, which made things more enjoyable.   The food was a little heavy on the oil, but not too heavy the way American diners are.",

I wasn't expecting much since it was an included meal on our tour, but I now rave about how amazing everything was at this restaurant - from their food and drinks to their service and level of professionalism.  Everything seemed to work out perfectly.  Their bruschetta was the best I've had, their pasta was perfect!  Their beef dish fell off the bone, it was so tender and moist. I can't wait to go back to that city, one reason being because of this place!  One thing to note is it's right next door to the Elephant House, renowned for the spot where JK Rowling wrote Harry Potter.",

That was our idea, Anita A and Tanja R got us a nice sunny table on a crowded terras. The waiting staff was busy, but trying very hard. And hard it must have been as they were fully dressed while the most punters were full on their way of getting drunk (in the most sophistictaed way only, mind you).   I ordered my Beer and it took about 3 chase ups to get it. - after that all was going swimmingly. We ordered a meal (Pasta Carbonara Classico), bottle of wine and dessert (affagato)  It was all yummy and well done to the waiters!  (and I have a better tan now as well)",

    "text": "edinburgh is almost over run for options when it comes to italian dining.  there is pretty much an italian restaurant available on most streets in the city with the choices being from quite good to quite mediocre.  however when a good standby is needed for a quick and not too pricey dinner Vittoria always comes to mind.  Vittoria is part of a rather small but impressive italian empire in the edinburgh dining scene.  there are two Vittoria's, la favourita, divino enoteca, and taste of italy in the family.  i've been to three out of the five and while la favourita is by far my favourita the Vittoria on Leith Walk is A-OK.  on a friday night they were able to fit two of us in after phoning only 30 minutes before arriving to get a table.  we did have to wait a few minutes when we arrived for our table to be ready but they have a small waiting area so it's not too much of a problem.  this was the first time i'd been in this branch since they had a massive refurb a few years ago so it's looking quite smart these days.  they seem to have opened up the space a bit as it's a it of an odd set up-sort of a U shape with two main rooms and space for tables along the back of the U near to where the kitchen is.    the service is ok, it's quite rushed in a way but i never felt forced to have to give the table back at any point.  however when we queried about our glass of prosecco not being full, we were sort of just dismissed by the waiter with a this is what the measure is comment.  it seemed smaller than a typical glass so not sure if he was just pawning us off instead of offering a solution.  the food though is tasty, i had the spaghetti and meatballs which was a good portion and filled me up nicely for my long run the next morning.  it was a  bit peppery but i'm not sure if that was due to me having fresh pepper grinded on top or if the sauce was peppery in general.  i had a bit of my friend's pizza which was quite tasty as well.  so for a good stand by with consistency in terms of food and quick service, Vittoria is definitely a good place to go.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to my visit to Vittoria. I had heard only good things and knowing it was part of the same people who do La Favorita I had high hopes for the evening.  In one word; good.  Not great, good.  An hour after arriving our orders were taken (18 people at 8pm get a bit tetchy when they have to wait so long! Luckily I had an emergency banana.)  I had the Pate Della Casa to start and it wasn't fantastic. I'm a pate fiend (and to be honest, Ondine has ruined me for life) but this was quite...meh...Served with 2 scoops of pate, 6 slices of bread and some red berry jam it was tasty but a tad underwhelming, considering it was marked as 'Recommended by the owner'. Other starters being stuffed into starving mouths around me were the calamari which was quite good, the goats cheese which looked and tasted really nice and the pork ribs which my friend devoured so I imagine they were tasty! For main, I had a Pizza Hawaii and it was a good pizza, again, not fantastic but definitely good. The portion sizes in Vittoria are ginormous and unfortunately I ate far too fast and was unable to finish my pizza but the staff kindly wrapped it up to take home.  The restaurant itself  has a bizarre layout! But is decked out in full Italian style and I quite like it. I had two problems with the service, one that they took a while to get going and two that once they were going they completely rushed it! My friend not only had an unfinished starter taken away from her but then had her bottle of wine poured for someone else! Apart from those minor issues it was all smiles and a bit of banter so not bad overall.  Vittorias didn't live up to my high expectations but I can't figure out if that's my fault or its.",

    "text": "I much prefer the other branch of Vittoria, on George IV Bridge.  Maybe it's because this one isn't right in the middle of the Old Town and so doesn't have the same bustling atmosphere, or maybe it's because there's not that much variation between the menus on offer in the two places. Either way, although I couldn't specifically put my finger on it I think that this Vittoria lacks a bit of the character of the other branch.  Don't get me wrong, the service was just as attentive in this one and the food was just as tasty. But I'd paid 7 in a taxi to get to this one, whereas I could have walked to the other one in under 10 minutes for free, and had pretty much exactly the same meal.",

The focus here is traditional quality Italian food straight up, so if you want a hearty portion of your favourite traditional pasta dish, or just a taste of something that is wholeheartedly home cooking, then Vittoria is your place. Being family owned, the feel of the restaurant is warm and welcoming, and the staff are cheery, friendly, and ever the Italian charmers. You just get that no nonsense, community, relaxed vibe about the place, so you always feel entirely comfortable coming in for a meal.There's an extensive breakfast, lunch and dinner menu, so you won't be stuck for options, even if you're a super fusspot when it comes to eating out.",

I've been here a few times with my friends and it always delivers the same quality of experience.  The dcor inside isn't the most modern, but it still feels comfortable and friendly from the moment you walk.  The service is also inviting and friendly an the food seems to take no time at all to reach you from the moment you order.  I went for the spaghetti carbonara the last time I was there (original, I know) and it was probably one of the best ones I've ever had.   To top off the great service and food, it's all quite cheap with mains costing about 5-6, so you get a decent, filling meal whch won't leave you out of pocket.  I would certainly recomment Vittoria, I just wish it wasn't so far away from where I live!",

The for starter we had the meat antipasti that stated the usual 'meat, cheese, olive oil, bread etc, but when it arrived their was a great selections of salami and chirizo, but only a small 'dollop' of cheese and 2 tiny pieces of bread, along with a slice of melon...still i fab stack of pickles and olives, we ofcourse had to order a basket of bread...i wanted cheese! like at least a couple of choices!!...I love cheese!!  For main, Robert ordered the pasta that he said ' it grew on him'  and I ordered pizza, unusal for me as i would normally always choose a pasta dish, the pizza was above average, and overall i enjoyed my meal, but then i have been on a big diet recently, so maybe anything more than 500 calories would be fabby to me ha!!  Would i go back?? No, however and a big however....i have had a takeaway pizza from here and they are much better! Defo for takeaway and cheaper!!",

The daughter had a pizza, which was very cheesy, and she was happy. I have forgotten the glass of wine but it went well with the food.
