Situated on Hanover Street up a small flight of stairs (definitely not accessible sadly) is this small burrito joint delivering up tasty bean, rice and meat packages in a large tortilla. You know the score.",

    "text": "After a day of soaking in a few fringe shows, I decided to stop by this wee shop to recharge my batteries, my sustenance of choice was the pulled pork burrito.   Blah. Just, no.  I mean, if you're looking for a cheap meal that'll fill you up, then by all means this place is for you. But heed my warning, this stuff in BLAND. The only flavour I got was from the jalapenos. It tasted like a jalapeno on white bread.   Seriously, do yourself the favour and pay a few more pounds at El Cartel around the corner.   It looks quite interesting from the outside but the interior is sparce, the bainmaries are tiny and the staff do not look all that interested in what they are serving you.    If you're looking for Mexican food around this area there are a few others to consider, but please do yourself the favour and just avoid this one.",

After waiting 10mins while 2 people were served, I ordered a chicken burrito which made using the last morsels of chicken (those tasted surprisingly alright), some very crusty beans which looked like dried dog food, and \"smoked hot\" sauce which I couldn't even taste. Oh and some crunchy bits of rice. My wife got a single, sad, tasteless taco.  It was basically a waste of time and about 10. Whatever.",

The place models itself 'street food'.  No frills but service was prompt, tacos were tasty with all the fillings.. (could have come warmer), and nice view to enjoy a coffee or read a book afterwards.  Was busier than I expected and opens around 11am-6pm.",

I had a chicken burrito and a steak taco and they were exactly what I needed.  The food is pretty simple- standard fast food Mexican along the lines of a Qdoba or Chipotle.  I only wish they had tortilla chips to go with the salsa and guacamole.  I thought the price was outstanding for the amount of food I got.",

It's a small place, no atmosphere, and the two guys were speaking another language which makes me a bit uncomfortable. I can't get food to go, because I have no where to go with the food- I live far away, and a park bench is not always inviting. I might return and scarf some tacos, but I won't hang around. Now, I'm on the hunt for a great taco in a cool joint.  Anyone......",

Staff weren't great, infact one was so hungover they had to leave to vomit whilst serving a customer. Unacceptable.  Also the butternut squash in the veggie taco was totally raw.  Has potential to be decent but obviously on this day noone was taking their role too seriously.",

    "text": "I was lured in here for lunch by the gluten free sign outside, and was very pleased with my decision! On a gluten free diet I thought Mexican food was beyond my reach, but this is not so at Taco Mazama. Reasonably priced food, the options are pretty basic (tacos, nachos or wraps) but you can mix and match fillings (kind of reminded me of a Mexican subway!). Not the place to go for a fancy meal but for a cheap lunch or dinner which tastes good and caters to a range of dietry requirements you can't go wrong! They even had a chart indicating which meal options contained gluten, dairy, eggs, nuts etc which made life so much easier. You definitely need at least 2 wraps or tacos for a meal as they're quite small, but when I visited they had a deal on for 3 wraps so that wasn't a problem :) will definitely return as they make dairy/gluten free eating easy!",

Ok , I was looking for a bite to eat one day before class and had walked past this place a million times and finally I went in. Mexican food that reminds me of America is hard to come by here so i wasn't expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised when I eat here. Basically you choose what you want in your burrito or whatever , they make it, you eat it. Nice an simple. I had chicken burrito with the works. They even threw guacamole and sour cream in for no extra charge. Was quite pleased with this burrito as it reminded me of street food vendors in California. Food was not the best I ever had but was still tasty. Prices I felt were a bit steep for a single burrito. But otherwise bueno and I will stop in again when I am hungry and on a time crunch. Place is A-ok in my book.",
