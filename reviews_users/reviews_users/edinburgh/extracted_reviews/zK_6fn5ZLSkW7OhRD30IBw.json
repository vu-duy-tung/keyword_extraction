    "text": "My colleague and I have been going to Kebab Mahal once a week for almost three years now. In that time my appreciation of good food has substantially increased, my tolerance of chilli has sky-rocketed, and my stomach has doubtless swelled to accommodate their generous helpings of curry and monster nans!   Without wanting to sound cliched, Kebab Mahal is all about the food. From the outside it looks totally uninspiring; the decor on the inside is pedestrian (it's basically a takeaway with some tables). What you will notice however is the comforting mix of people, including many 'local types' who obviously go there all the time, rubbing shoulders (sometimes literally) as they eat. Throughout, the genial manager Mr Khan and his staff move unhurriedly, attending to the thronging clientele as they can. One of the refreshing things about Kebab Mahal is its authenticity. The ownership makes no bones about its Muslim identity (there is no booze and Friday lunchtimes are closed for prayers), but it does so in a way that is reassuringly natural.   Returning to the food, the one gripe I have about Kebab Mahal is their extremely limited menu. Visit any regular curry takeaway and you will be presented with a list of 'Old Favourites' or the like (from Korma to Vindaloo), next to a somewhat longer list of 'specialities'. Invariably these turn out to differ little in taste or appearance. At Kebab Mahal the selection is admittedly small, but each curry is a thoroughly distinct 'beast'. The Pathia is thin and sticky (don't let that description put you off!), the Ceylon is packed with coconut and when you order a lentil dish like Dhansak a lentil dish is very much what you get. The last two aren't even on the menu, but the staff take such orders (including those for the uber-hot Phall) in their stride. I haven't gone out of my way to test Mr Khan and his staff on their menu flexibility, but I guess they can pretty much back up their claim to cook curry dishes to order. The other thing I would draw attention to is the lamb, in that it really doesn't taste like lamb. And this is a good thing!  I'd be perfectly willing to believe it was a different animal altogether, whose flesh is entirely preferable to that of lamb. Finally, the taste of the curries is almost always divine (packed with flavour as Masterchef's John and Gregg would say), although an abundance of oil sometimes make an unwelcome appearance. The reviewer on a different site who said this is the best restaurant in the world: he can't be far wrong!",

It's a well known must-eat in Edinburgh for students, tourists and professionals alike. The only reason it misses out a star is because of the lack of seating and sometimes late service. However, it all adds to it's charm. Situated in Edinburgh's south side, on Nicholson square, well known for it's Desi and Middle Eastern food joints as well as the Mosque Kitchen, 'closed for prayer on Friday', Kebab Mahal is one of Edinburgh's best.",

Kebabs and tikkas are succulent and delicious. Vegetarian side dishes can be asked for in main course portions and they are really good. Baigan bhaji, dal, aloo gobhi in particular. Their snacks (pakora, samosa etc) lack flavour and are best avoided. I would have rated this place higher if their service was better.

However, Kebab Mehal is different. This Turkish diner provides gives you with an excellent portion for a much cheaper price than you would usually expect and it tastes much better. Furthermore, there is a bigger portion of salad so you can even fool yourself into thinking you has a healthy meal. This Turkish restaurant even serves quality food outside kebabs and there were even vegetarian options last time I was there. Finally on both my three visits the standard of hygiene and speed of service have been excellent.   It provides a great meal to end any quality night out on a high note!!",

    "text": "I visited Kebab Mahal for the first time this last week and really loved it. We went there on recommendation from a friend who said they do delicious kebabs and as we arrived people were sat outside eating a variety of curries.   So what intended to be a quick trip to buy a kebab ended up with us buying two plates of curry, two bowls of rice, an awesome nan bread and a drink. The curry was really delicious, I had a lamb curry which didn't have a lamb taste but nonetheless tasted delicious. My partner had a chicken curry and she asked for chilli's to be added which they did. The nan bread was awesome. It was freshly cooked and had mince in the middle.   So again what started as a trip for a kebab ended up with a feast and we still bought a large chicken tikka kebab (which we intended to save until the next day but ended up eating after we got home).   Kebab Mahal along with Mosque Kitchen are easily my two favourite curry shops in Edinburgh.   Service was pretty quick for our main food although we had to wait a while while our kebab was cooked, which is fair enough. A note if you're visiting, this place became absolutely packed out just after we arrived. We managed to order straight away but just after we sat down there were four or five people waiting to order. A testimony to how good the food is.",

The above is just proof of how busy this place is  and for good reason. Packed with all types of people until late, the food in here is delicious and cheap. A large range of curries are made with the most tender chicken and lamb or veg if that's your thing  you'll never have a piece of fatty or tough chicken/lamb in here, which is a lot more than can be said for a lot of Edinburgh curry joints. Other mains include a selection of biryanis. The rice is pure buttery goodness, and a large variety of breads are on offer. Also on offer are pakoras, chaat, kebab, samosas and other tandoori starters. From midnight  2am, pizzas, kebabs and starters are served. For dessert pick up indian ice cream, and other pastries and sweets such as Paklava (Baklawa), Gulab Jammun, Baba baba, Rasmalai or have some lassi or tea to finish your meal. The atmosphere in here is buzzed, the decor simple and honest with regulars and visitors as Kebab Mahal is often cited as worth a visit to Edinburgh's Southside, where you'll find plenty of international and ethnic diners and takeaways.",

This hole in the wall restaurant was to be a great secret delicious place, instead it turned out that it was a filthy hovel with terrible starch to fill the belly.  Waiters with foul yellow stains from their own food eating misadventures, meat sitting in unrefridgerated counters and a dining room that resembled the boiler room from a b horror film.  The food was not cheap in comparison to some amazing restaurants we enjoyed at lunch such as mussel and steak just a short walk away. I know this is supposedly a good place for university students but I would gladly go back to Ramon noodles and fluorescent Mac and cheese.  They seat you at a dingy table while you contemplate running out before someone notices you and then man with a untucked shirt with stains and an unkempt beard asks for your order. The smell of stale food and dry spices fill the nostrils and then the food arrives. Rice that's lukewarm and veggies straight from the freezer in spices to hide the freezer burn taste. Singed bread that is cool as well and soon you wonder if all they have in the kitchen is a freezer, a toaster and an old microwave. The bill is not printed out but rather shown to you on a calculator... Hmm I wonder why... Do yourself a favor and call the health inspector on this Burke and Hare show they call an Indian restaurant. Run",

I shuffled in, holding my stomach, bent over and clearly in the final stages of hunger-pains. After having placed my order and being greeted by almost all of the friendly clientele and staff the curry arrived. A light opened up above me, trumpets sounded, a harp was gently plucked. And I may or may not have taken a nose-dive into the curry.  Look, I'm sensitive to heat and so this burnt my throat and mouth to a point of angst-ridden pain but it was soooo good that despite the pain, I couldn't stop eating. (My fault for trusting them when they said there were very few chillies in there, \"almost none\").  What am I saying? I'm saying get your bee-hinds over here and have ye some curry!

Mister Khan is really nice fellow and his friends in the back make tremendous curries. You could just wander in here and get a kebab or some pakora. However, the folks who know will sit in the back, get yourself a lovely beverage (no alcohol served - like all of the best Indian restaurants) and enjoy the fabulous curries. The portions are immense and the curries and breads are always well made.    Finally, when you leave the price will startle you. It is stupidly low priced.

Service goes from non existent to terrible, probably because \"waiters\" come from Zombieland, and just because of that I'm not eating there as often as I did. A couple of times I ordered a lamb biryani and after waiting 45+ minutes I needed to leave and go to another carry out as I was starving, or, you order a main course + a garlic nan...but the nan bread never appeared. Sometimes you place an order but the waiter does not even go to the kitchen to pass it!!! Approximately 4 years ago they used the finest basmati rice, but after that rice crisis in South East Asia (when rice prices doubled up) the owner changed to a cheaper version of it and that drop in quality was very noticeable. Also by talking to regulars & tourists..the complain is always the same...food takes ages to get to you. In any case if it's not that busy you may have a good meal at a very affordable price...but don't go there if you are in a hurry. Hope it helps",

    "text": "I've only been to Kebab Mahal once and that was the first night after I moved into my new flat last summer.  Four of us turned up and waited for about five minutes for a table because it was well beyond maximum capacity as it was so busy.  I ordered the lamb balti with rice and a naan and we were eventually seated.  The atmosphere is particularly special as it is ethnically diverse with cool music and amazing smells wafting from the kitchen.  It was a very fortunate thing that it had a good atmosphere because we literally waited for about an 45 minutes for our food arrive, but when it did it was well worth it.   The lamb was good quality with virtually no sinuous or fatty bits amongst it and the flavour of the sauce was delicious.  It was seriously spicy, but my flatmate ordered the chicken madras which blew my head off after just a mouthful and he was literally dripping with sweat after about five minutes of eating it.  Kebab Mahal serves authentic Indian food at relatively cheap prices and is definitely worth a visit for an amazing dinner any night of the week.  As the name suggests they specialise in kebabs and, although I haven't tried them myself, they're meant to be incredible.",

Maybe it was because we were looking forward to it so much that our expectations were somewhat dimmed. The food was generally average, we felt. My Vindaloo was spicy enough but the meat was a bit tough and, temperature-wise, could've done with being hotter. The naan was not great and didn't seem fresh or have that \"just cooked\" fluffiness. Service was adequate, but slow, as there was a steady stream of people picking up takeouts. You help yourself to soft drinks from a chiller at the back. The prices were reasonable. Sorry, other lovers of this place, but Mother India is miles better (and not a lot more expensive) so we'll be sticking to that, or Kebabish.",

If you are one of those people who prefer posh restaurants over good food, then my friend this place is not for you. This place looks more like a fast food joint but but but.... the food is nothing like fast food. The two times we were here we tried the shammi kebab, chicken tandoori, chicken bhuna, kharahi murgh accompanied with super yummy tandoori garlic naan. All the dishes including the naan was absolutely delicious. At the end after you have stuffed yourself with these goodies, if you still have any room left for dessert do try the baklava. Best baklavas i have ever tasted. We also tried the almond cake which was also yummmm. Delicious food, excellent service and warm & welcoming staff = awesome gastronomic experience.",

Don't expect haute cuisine dining or even proper seating, this is a small joint where the curries steal all the fame. We had Chicken Karahi, Naan, Keema Rice and tried some more stuff from a friendly Scottish guest who was a regular here.   The only thing I personally didn't like was the mixed appetizer plate which was precooked and not crunchy anymore. It didn't pass the excellence test in my book. Yet, there is an infinite amount of two chutneys to go along with the main dishes, so I'd call it a draw.   The owners are a friendly bunch and you won't leave this place with an empty stomach, so if you are in need of a good, proper spice cuisine, stop by and throw some money at this place. You won't regret it, it's great.",

But now I always feel the need to go there. Because the food is fantastic. And oh, so cheap.   This is not a posh restaurant. Oh no. It's formica tables and stools and weird items stuffed up the back of the room. There's even two parts to the place, separated by a proper wall and accessible only by going outside and entering another main door. This is what I like to call personality.   Me and my other half had an incredible meal here, in the completely separate restaurant from everyone else. We ordered a starter of onion bhajis (three arrived the size of steering wheels) followed by a veritable feast of Indian main courses. I opted for two sides and a naan to keep me filled and the bloke opted for a main course, rice, naan and a side.   We couldn't finish it all and took the rest home. All that wonderful food only came to 26. And the service was good too - our waiter was pleasant and we even helped him shift some tables to accommodate us.   It felt like a mad family meal - will absolutely, definitely, totally be back for more. Long live Kebab Mahal!",

    "text": "Do not judge a book by its cover. And certainly do NOT judge Kebab Mahal by its appearance!   It will reward you with one delightful indian food experience. From the chicken tikka karahi to lamb tikka bhuna, every plate is delicious and generous on  the size. Accompanied with a couple of nans and you have an unforgettable ethnic feast! Our meal ended with a baklava and a kataifi which was equally delicious and we hardly reached a 24 bill.   Best Indian in Edinburgh for sure, and if you know the cardinality of the set \"Indian restaurants in Edinburgh\", that says a lot.",

    "text": "This is an addiction. If I am put into rehab for this addiction I will escape, and find my way back to the palace of Indian food in Edinburgh known as Kebab Mahal.  The Taj Mahal has nothing on Kebab Mahal. In fact, seeking asylum in this Mahal will do you much better than the other Mahal. The inscription at the Taj Mahal was obviously mistakenly put there when it was meant to be here, at Kebab Mahal:  \"Should guilty seek asylum here, Like one pardoned, he becomes free from sin. Should a sinner make his way to this mansion, All his past sins are to be washed away. The sight of this mansion creates sorrowing sighs; And the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes. In this world this edifice has been made; To display thereby the creator's glory.\"  Wash away your past sins by eating at this mansion of Halal traditional tandoori and curry dishes. For it is here that you will be pardoned.",

    "text": "Cheap curries.  The chicken and mushroom was nice.  Big chunks of white meat chicken.  Sis liked the chicken tikka masala.  I thought it was too rich and creamy, but I like mine more \"tomatey\" and sis doesn't.  The aubergine was drenched in oil.  Tasty, but super greasy. The naan was huuuuge.  It was 4 times the size of the naan that I had at London restaurant.  We did experience the MSG thirst a couple of hours after dinner though.   The doner kebab is horrifying.  Yes, it's HUGE, but the \"meat\" is dry and awful and the whole thing was drenched in a neon red sauce that just ended up disintegrating the pita bread into a mushy red mess.  Don't get that on clothing. You'll never get it out.   Popular place for local students.  Come at the wrong time and you'll be waiting a while.  Call ahead with your order as they advise on the website.   Would return, but only for the curries.",

    "text": "It would be easy to mistake Kebab Mahal for just another place that sells processed shaved meats, its unassuming and dated appearance not doing it any favours however the old saying is True - one should not judge a book by it's cover...  The food is excellent - from the mild rich and creamy chicken tikka masala to the more spicy madras or vindaloo which have a good balance of heat and flavour and real kebabs. The only thing ever to take me by surprise is that the chicken pakora is on the bone - delicious but something to be aware of.  To sum up, yes it can be very busy, is small and looks dated however if you want good food at a good price Kebab Mahal is one of the best places to get a curry in Edinburgh and I for one hope it never changes.",
