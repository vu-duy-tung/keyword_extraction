As stated the tart was nice but on the cheap end of any tart.  The donuts were tasty but are there tradiotional for afternoon tea or a quick/ cheap substitute for the voucher.    Now.  It's not all negatives before you switch off.    The tea/coffee is on tap so we could drink as much as we could.  The sandwiches were nice. Tasty but could do with more filling considering we asked for NO EGG may0 or an extra sandwich of the other one.  I think the scone was highlight as it was nice and fluffy and oh yeah WARM!!  Although the cream was not proper clotted cream but squeezy cream.  Ok ok.  I'm not to sure what to expect when you buy a voucher but,  If you want good word of mouth you need to provide a little more dazzle!  Of the recent yelp reviews this is clearly not the case.  I've been dazzled with afternoon teas else where, so wouldn't rush back here.",

    "text": "Four of us dined on a Sunday evening and left satisfied on the whole. We started with a fish sharing board, which included mackerel, salmon, and I believe trout, along with eggplant slices and other vegetables. Very good starter. My date has this thing about haggis - he has toured all around the UK and tries it wherever it's offered. The verdict was a decent haggis, which I tasted (off the bucket list). I had the chicken wrapped in Parma ham - \"dry\" was my overall impression. Salads were good.  The alcohol solution was pretty positive. Innis and Gunn in the bottle, a nice brew indeed. Also very nice scotch. Glenkinchie was the special - loved it.  The service was polite but a little disorganized.  I was surprised that two reviews were one star. It was not a total disaster like the other reviewers wrote (perhaps they've upped their game in the meantime?) - there was something good for everyone.",

    "text": "afternoon tea is a bit of a british insitution and a lovely wee treat for a girls get together at the weekend. a group of six of us had bought an itison deal for a cocktail and the traditional afternoon tea delights.  so we made a book and a windy saturday afternoon in january we went along.  on first entering the restaurant, it all looks very nice.  Broadsheet Bistro is part of the fraser suites just off the royal mile.  the decor is a chic townhouse sort of look but very luxurious.  the staff were pleasant and once we were all seated set about making our cocktails after taking our order for tea.  however after that it all went a bit downhill.  cocktails arrived and i think they were supposed to be a cosmopolitan, but it mainly just tasted like cranberry juice.  in fact i'm not actually convinced that there was alcohol in the drink at all.  next the afternoon tea began to arrive.  there was a plate with skewers of little triangle sandwiches and the traditional three tier stand with cakes and scones.  the sandwiches were ok but the bread was a bit stale so not great.  and the cakes.... store bought doughnuts and a poorly made strawberry tart which was really just a tart base with some whipped cream messily spooned in and topped with a strawberry.  the scones were warmed but clearly not homemade either.  if i'd paid for this afternoon tea i would have been sorely disappointed.  thankfully my friend and i got the deal for free since three other people bought it off her link.  it's a real shame as the staff were lovely and the restaurant itself quite nice.  but the food was a serious let down and maybe something they should look at resolving before offering any further deals!",

    "text": "For those who don't feel like reading a long review: One of the WORST dining experiences that I have had anywhere in the world.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  My family and I came here after taking a highland tour, which offered a discount coupon for the Broadsheet Bistro.  We arrived at 7pm on a Friday evening.  Our first warning should have been the fact that the place was completely empty except for a man and his young daughter who were eating dinner.  The interior was nice, but they had loud club music playing an an inappropriate volume.  It was so distracting that we actually asked them to turn it off.  Our waitress was impossibly inept: Either she was paralyzed by nervousness or did not speak a word of English, as all four of us had to repeat our orders multiple times.  She was unable to answer any questions that we had about the menu, as she genuinely did not understand what we were saying.  The question: \"Does this come with any vegetable or salad?\" left her speechless and stuttering out a request for clarification, which in turn had to be twice repeated.    In addition to the food, we ordered drinks two glasses of wine and a beer.  Our waitress returned to state that they did not have one type of wine that was ordered, nor the beer.  We reordered.  She returned again to say that actually, they only had one type of wine and one type of beer in stock.    When my entree arrived -- the pasta with broccoli and cheddar -- it was the least inspiring dish that I have ever laid eyes on.  Imagine putting just those three ingredients -- half a cup of pasta, three pieces of broccoli and a bit of shredded orange cheddar -- in a bowl and then microwaving it.  That was my meal for the lovely price of 15+  Two of us ordered the apple cobbler in an attempt to end the meal on a sweet note.  The filling could have come out of a can; the cobbler top was not cooked in the least and was actually a liquid dough.  Disgusting.  I didn't go back for more after my first awful bite.  As the icing on this putrid cake, the manager claimed that the restaurant had changed hands a week ago and that he could not honour our coupon.  This, after we had to complain about the music, our waitress and our drinks.  Poor, poor show.",

    "text": "We were staying at the Fraser Suites Hotel which is great so we thought this restaurant would be great too. We came about 30 minutes before their breakfast ends. We decided to do their breakfast buffet. When we got to the food table, there were hardly any food left. We started with what they have at the moment thinking they would replenish the almost empty containers on the table. We waited but they did not. We asked and the only answer we got is 'sorry, no\". We ended up scavenging the food containers for whatever food we can get which is just horrible after we paid about 12 pounds each. And whatever food we got, they were not great. They should have not offered us the breakfast buffet if they knew they willnot replenish the food. We would have just ordered food from the menu.  The interior is nice though... but you can't eat it. You'd rather go to places like World's End, Rabbie Burn's and many other places that serves breakfast than eat here. You'll get your money's worth elsewhere.",
