This place sure does do good pizza - I particularly like the range of toppings - they have very few set-topping pizzas, mostly you just mix and match and put all the things you love most on - I had tuna and artichoke, mm mm! The dessert menu is also rather good, especially for chocolate lovers like myself - I had THE richest chocolate cheesecake ever, couldn't finish it, always a good sign! The waiter was very friendly, and although it was busy so that service could be a little slow at times, it wasn't really a problem. A good evening was had by all.",

The voucher was for a meal for four up to the value of 80. This was for food only. We started with a variety of starters, garlic bread with cheese, mushrooms baked in garlic butter & buffallo wings in honey & garlic sauce. Garlic seemed to be a bit of a theme there. We all opted for fillet steak as a main course, this was seared in the kitchen & brought to the table on a lava rock, which was very hot. The idea being that you cook each bite of your steak just how you like it. The steaks were served with potato wedges & a variety of dips. The lava rock stayed hot throughout the meal & came in handy to reheat the wedges also. Three of us ordered dessert, which were served with a choice of cream or ice cream. A chocolate brownie, baked cheesecake & a Choco woco whako, a chocolate overload, chocolate brownie, chocolate ice cream, chocolate sauce & goodness knows what else was in there.  The food was great & no complaints about the service which was cheerful, helpful & timely, despite the waitress having a bit of a mishap with a glass or two. I will most certainly return, perhaps I may even get round to trying the pizza, which looked delicious!",

The restaurant also offers a gluten free base for every pizza on the menu, as well as the option of spicy or non-spicy sauce, so there's an option to suit everyone. Reasonably priced and freshly made, this is definitely one of Edinburgh's best pizzerias.",

They will also make gluten free pizzas on request for a small surcharge - one of the few takeaways in Edinburgh to offer this. The only downside is that, probably as a result of their popularity, you have to be prepared for a long wait as delivery usually takes a minimum of an hour.",

The staff were very efficient and seemed to know when to come over and take our order or drinks etc, despite being so busy. The tables were crammed close together but the staff can carry the huge pizzas above their heads and weave through! The pizzas are excellent as are the barbeque chicken wings for starter - be ready to share them as the bowl i got was huge!",

There pizzas are fantastic homemade bases and tons of topping to choose from both sweet and savoury. You can also have the option of sharing a pizza having different toppings on each side of the pizza or if you would prefer small individual pizzas for one. I love the macho nachos which are amazing and the deluxe hot chocolate with cream and mashmallows. I cant personally comment on the puddings as i am always to full to have a sweet but they do look very appealing. Being a coeliac and requiring gluten free foods mammas pizzas is a life saver allowing you to order gluten free pizza for a small extra cost and marking gluten free choices on the menu they also have gluten free beer on there menu. I lookm forward to visiting mammas again soon.",

They have personally painted the walls with a  surrealistic piece depicting flying mushrooms, chili-pepper butterflies and a Pepperoni-Man saving the day. Funny!  We sat down on a table for two and we ordered our pizza - 9\" with 3 toppings - I got pepperoni, mushrooms and chili-peppers (was I subliminally influenced by the painting? Yes I was..) It was a very well filled pizza and very tasty.  I enjoyed the pizza crust, which I normally don't(!) and appreciated the laid back, but precise way of serving. They enquired if we were OK, we got our drinks served in time and we got to take the left over slices with us.   I did find it a bit cold near the doors and I had a good view of all the people on the outside who peered in to see what this place is like. I made an effort to smile and wave to many of them to show how  good it was - but somehow the peepers backed away from the windows very quick when I did that.   Recommend for a quick visit or even a nice afternoon late snack / meal with a bunch of friends or family, they had a cartwheel of a pizza available to serve to a big table of 8 - it was huge!",

But - the good stuff first - Mamma's does a whole range of different pizza and caters for gluten free, which is always worth an extra star. But, the pizza I tried had really meagre toppings and a heavy base. Seafood, vegetarian, they all looked sparse and personally, for me pizza is all about the toppings, the base just holds it all together. When the balance is lost, you have lost me as well.

    "text": "My first full day in Edinburgh 18 months ago, I found myself in an Internet cafe and was googling 'gluten free in Edinburgh'. My fingers hovered over the keys as I waited, breathless with anticipation, as to what results google would yield.  I nearly exploded with excitement when I discovered I could get gluten free pizza at Mamma's in the Grassmarket. Armed with a 'leaving gift' of my Edinburgh guidebook, I headed towards the pizza.  I loved Mamma's and have returned tons since. I was able to 'recreate' a Sloppy Giuseppe (chili beef, onions and peppers) and grab a GF beer at the same time (heaven). So, it was a rainy day but I was in a little sunny corner of America, munching down on pizza, drinking beer, and listening to classic eighties rock.  Whilst loitering between interviews, I found myself with time to kill and I headed to Mamma's last week. The pizza base was thinner than before (good!), nice and crispy (hate doughy pizza's). The tomato sauce base comes in mild or spicy - I went for spicy but there was a little too much sauce and it was slightly bitter but the other toppings were generous. No sides this time but the sweet potato fries seasoned with paprika are am-az-ing and if in full pig out mode, then the warmed chocolate brownie (speaking from one who has GF brownie fatigue) is great with vanilla ice-cream.  Edinburgh is served well for GF pizza lovers but as my first love in Edinburgh, Mamma's has a special place in my heart....",

I've been here a few times with my friends over the past year and we've always enjoyed ourselves.  It's famed locally for its pizzas, but it also offers a good range of other authentic Italian dishes like stone baked steak and lasagne.  The meals are served in good, filling portions and I've never left Mamma's hungry, even after having just a main course. Pizzas, however, are their speciality and they offer a plethora of toppings, from spicy Italian sausage to haggis!  On weekends it gets pretty busy and can feel a little tightly packed.

We ordered the garlic cheese bread (plus a side of pizza sauce to dunk said garlic bread into) and a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was flavorless and I had to dunk each bite into the side of pizza sauce to give it a little hint of flavor.  The best part of Mamma's was the service. I know, I dare say that service was good in the UK but it was. This is most likely because our server was Canadian and had just moved to Scotland a couple months prior. She was great and the Hoegaarden was great too but that's about it.  As a side note, they have a huge selection of gluten free options. I think that this is why Mamma's is rated so highly.  Dress code is casual - you can pretty much get away with wearing anything here. I would not dress up, that's for sure.",

    "text": "Thanks first to Claire L for this recommendation, it was a fantastic find!  I have seen Mamma's in the grassmarket for 3 years, but never thought about going inside. It just seemed like another tourist trap by the side of the castle. Then I found out I couldn't eat gluten anymore, and needed to find an alternative to my favourite foods.  I had heard that the beloved la favorita's gluten free pizzas were pretty lame. I rang up this morning to ask whether they made them up fresh, and they admitted that they made them all fresh in the morning, but not fresh to order. I love pizza dough which has just been cooked, and mamma's really does well in this respect.  My boyfriend and I went with another couple to Mamma's this evening, armed with Itison tokens (again, thanks Claire L): 11 for 2 9 inch pizzas or gourmet burgers with one glass of wine or beach each. This worked out as a really cheap meal, as we got to choose 3 toppings. I went for goats cheese, olives and pepper with a spicy pizza sauce. There were lots of other exciting options, including cactus, vegetarian sausage, marshmallows and chocolate! Everyone else had normal pizza bases, which were slightly more golden looking than mine, though I admit that it's difficult to make gluten free flour turn that colour. I admit my only criticism would be that the base was quite powdery underneath. Thery were generous with the toppings, and the base was pretty crispy-hate soggy/stodgy pizza bases. The pizzas seemed quite small on the plate, but were slightly thicker than Italian pizzas, so filled you up much quicker. I had a glass of nero d'avola, which was really lovely. The others went for a pint of beer.  Towards the end of the meal, my boyfriend found a piece of plastic in his meal. When the waitress asked if everything was okay, I said \"Yeah the pizza was lovely, but we found this in his pizza...\" She came back after 10 minutes with a gluten free brownie with vanilla ice cream, and a slice of NY vanilla cheesecake with strawberry ice cream. I quickly said shotgun staring at the GF brownie, which I put in my bag with the intent of eating it for breakfast, stuffed from the pizza. The others shared the ice cream and cheesecake, both of which said were lovely.  I can imagine this being slightly expensive if you were going to eat here without a discount, but with the discount we got a great deal, and the staff were extremely attentive and friendly.  The interior was very clean, and reminiscent of an American diner. I saw other diners going for burgers, milkshakes and rootbeer floats... Always interesting! Mamma's have a great location too, right in the heart of the grassmarket, at the foot of the castle.",

You can also get lager or cider too! Brilliant!

    "text": "I love pizza, and hence when I heard that Mamma's served the \"best pizza in Edinburgh\" I was excited.  And I wasn't too disappointed...  Mamma's offers both indoor and outdoor seating, although I'd highly recommend heading indoors just to enjoy some of the atmosphere.  Inside, it is very interesting.  There is lot's of retro, almost graffiti style artwork on the walls, the subject of which is largely caricatures of the available pizza toppings.  This artwork provides a contrast with the furnishings which are traditional and wooden.   The toppings available are fantastic. there is a variety of cheeses available besides mozzarella, including goat's cheese and blue cheese. You can have things I would never have considered putting on a pizza myself, including apple and even cactus. Furthermore, you have the option of having your pizza made with the mild or the spicy tomato sauce.  It's also not just pizza on offer. Other dishes available include steak and pasta. The pizza's have deliciously crisp bases and the ratio of cheese to other toppings is just right. A particular highlight for me was the prosciutto and pineapple topping.   While this place is good, if it wasn't for the 40% discount I receive due to Snapfax (a student discount book), I would consider it too pricey.  If you wish to eat out and it's delicious pizza you're after, this is the place to go. However, if you're not too fussed about the whole eating out part and are just after some delicious pizza, I'd recommend Papa John's.",

    "text": "This Italian restaurant at the Grassmarket was worryingly empty when a friend and I walked up to it; it was good weather and we'd just spent a lovely hour lunching and lounging at Made in Italy. All the outdoor seats of the restaurants and pubs we walked past were full, except for Mamma's. However, we did check out the menu, which is definitely unique! You've the option of truly creating your own pizza, with banana and Danish blue cheese amongst the choice of toppings. Their pricy mains, such as seared steak you can cook yourself on a hot stone (original!) and Cajun salmon, may have contributed to the empty seats, which really does puzzle me because the menu looked awesome. So awesome I'll upload a picture.",

Situated down at the Grassmarket, Mamma's is not small but not large inside, just the right size for an independent pizzeria. The interior is slightly retro with lots and lots of literature and posters about upcoming gigs and comedy shows!   Apart from this, I suppose the pizza is the main attraction. With nice, crispy Italian bases, the pizzas are fantastic! From a margarita to a hot and spicy Americano, the pizzas are full of bursting flavours! Furthermore, you do not just need to sit inside to experience the taste of the food, you can actually order and pick them up, and eat them in the luxury of your own home!   If you want a great meal in Grassmarket, you will be hard pushed to find a better place, and for pizza, it is simply one of the best in Edinburgh!",

Pizza Express is eons better. I ordered a 12 inch pepperoni pizza- it had too much cheese and only about 8 pepperonis on the whole thing. The chicken wings left something to be desired as well. For the same price we ate at a fantastic Italian place down the road.   The service was bad. When it came time to pay the bill, we waited at the table with our bill and card clearly visible and didn't receive any service. We then decided to go up to the counter to pay where we stood for about 5 more minutes waiting to be acknowledged by the staff. It seemd like they didn't want us to pay for our food.  Serious disappointment.",

It is one of very few independent dedicated pizza joints in Edinburgh, I'd be hard pushed to name another one - they must've scared the competition away! Mamma's definitely knows how to do pizza well: thin and crispy bases with lots of exotic toppings (marshmallow anyone?). The menu has a few starters (go for the macho nachos), but the main event is obviously the pizza. It comes in four different sizes, helpfully illustrated by a ruler on the menu, and you're encouraged to order a large one and share it between your party, this adds to the convivial atmosphere and also makes things a little cheaper. There are gluten/wheat free options so those with intolerances can join in the fun too.  Tasty pizza, central location and student discount - what's not to love?",

I will give Mamma's credit for having a decently long topping list for the pizzas. However, the crust was too dense and the sauce wasn't particularly tasty. Overall though, the pizza was OK - nothing too special, but certainly not bad.  My biggest disappointment was the garlic bread. It was too expensive, too thin, over-toasted, and had barely any garlic butter on it!  The atmosphere was fun and friendly.  In summary, if you are expecting great American style pizza here in Edinburgh, Mamma's simply does not deliver. The pizza is decent, but nothing to write home about.",

What was inside was just as generic (and soggy) and nothing like the Mammas pizzas I remember from the past.   On the phone I was asked if I wanted spicy or mild but that didn't seem to translate to much on the plate. They may as well have asked if I wanted bland or blander.   As for the Buffalo wings coated in Mammas secret spicy recipe and served with your choice of sauces, I think they may have waived a some BBQ sauce nearby but three of the wings didn;t even have any sauce on them. If they were coated in some secret spicy recipe I think the secret will be safe for a while.   I used to like Mammas but will probably be taking my custom elsewhere in future. The one star is for the quick delivery.",

I was at first turned off because the steak was raw but I didn't know that the stone was super super hot and was cooking the steak. I cut the steak up to help with the cooking process, but honestly, I probably didn't have to.   Once it got done to a medium well, I took a bite...it was Damn Good!  The meat was tender, no fat and not stringy.  Very good steak. I guess it's from the dry aging?  Not sure. All I know is that it was tasty. The two pizzas ordered by my wife and daughter were good too per them.  The service was quick and friendly too.   Oh and thanks to Yelp, my wife and I got a free starter with each full priced meal!  I got chicken wings, which in my opinion were just okay. My wife got the garlic bread which was pretty good; light, airy, and garlicky.",

We got the nachos which come with guacamole, sour cream, salsa, jalapenos and a spicy meat chilly (they also offer a vegetarian version).  We ordered their individual pizzas and be aware that they are big and can satisfy a couple of people.  We ordered The Hot One! Jalapenos, spicy beef, pepperoni, ham and red onions. We also ordered The Matador - Chorizo, pepperoni, chicken and red onions.  Washed it all down with some cold beers - Peroni & Barney's Extra Pale.

Probably some of the better wing quality I have ever experienced in Scotland although they are simply served fried with a side of ranch / blue cheese dip. They don't toss then in any sort of buffalo sauce which is a shame as the wing quality is so good.  The pizzas are pretty good although I prefer a crispier crust and whilst these weren't deep dish they felt a bit to thick for my liking. Still, very good quality toppings, generous portions and good sauce.  The service from the staff is very good. Mainly students as you will in the main find in this area. They are very friendly, interested and eager to please. Price wise it is very reasonable and i would recommend overall. I would rate 4.5 stars on the whole and will come back again.",

The pepperoni pizza, for a lack of better words was... basic. The BBQ D2 packed a flavor punch. It had sausage with a hint taste of bbq flavor in the sauce. The prawns were pretty good sized enough for a good bite. The red peppers packed a kick but also had a tasty sweet after taste. We could only handle 9 inches of pizza each.

We were quite hungry by the time we arrived here in the early evening, our huge hotel breakfast had worn off and our feet were weary from a day wandering round the world heritage city.    We both like pizza, but havn't had any since we became a gluten free home.. usually we go Indian when eating out as it's easier to see what suits gluten free diets, and we are still getting used to the eating out situation, but were trusting the Yelpers on this one.. the menu here is almost as if 'non GF' being the exception as you can eat everything except the items with stars.  Our waitress informed us we could choose half and half pizzas if we couldn't decide, there were at least 4 pre-suggested veggie choices, with loads of veggie toppings, and two different GF base sizes.  We like to share so got 2 x 12\" GF pizzas and tried out all 4 vegetarian topping ideas!   We were both expecting one of those pre-bought bases which look less than appetising in the packet, but imagine our complete joy when hand made and superbly crafted pizzas arrived on silver platters.. made just for us!  Each pizza was clearly hand made with love, and we had 2 with 4 choices on halves: -The veggie = Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Garlic, Tomatoes, Black Olives -Cheese 3PO = Cheddar, Mozzarella & Swiss cheeses -Gusto del papa = Red Onion Marmalade, Goats Cheese, Fresh Basil -Club med = Peppers, Black and Green Olives, Red Onion, Garlic oil, Rocket (and no Parmesan, as this is not veggie)  The staff couldn't have been nicer, they know everything about the menu and all of their food and drink, and are super cheery.  There is free wifi, so you can easily pay with Zapper.  Everything about this place is 5 stars... thank you Mamma's :)",

    "text": "I love Mamas. Proper relaxed feel, superb pizzas and friendly staff.  On the popular Grassmarket in Edinburgh this is prime for attracting tourists, but locals shouldn't be scared off. It's cosy inside, but I've never had a wait long for a seat. Once your sat down, you start to browse the menu - and now comes the hard bit: choosing your pizza. Mama's has a couple of pre-assigned ones but the real star is the 'choose your own' - a basic cheese & tomato (you can have the spicy sauce, which I recommend) and then you can select from a long list of ingredients - ham, chicken, chorizo, spinach, peppers, onions, pineapple, black pudding, haggis (well this is scotland), banana, Nutella. Yup, there's a ridiculous choice of toppings!  Oh and I didn't tell you the best bit - if you're coeliac or avoiding gluten for health reasons, not only can they do your pizza base gluten free, Mama's also has beers to suit your disagreeable tummy!   Pop in and try my favourite pizza - black pudding, calamari and pineapple!",

    "text": "Place is nice inside. American dining with nice photography on the walls. Service was great and I liked the staff. I ordered the chicken wings to start, which were tasty. Then had a medium pizza. Now the pizza for me just wasn't the best. It wasn't doughy enough and didn't find it very soft. It would have been nice to have proper mozzarella circles on the pizza rather than typical shredded cheese. This wouldn't be my first choice of somewhere to eat out in Edinburgh but was decent food and a good price - personally just not my favourite. But it is fab they cater so well to people with a gluten intolerance.",

    "text": "Quite possibly the best (American style) pizza in all of Edinburgh.   Ambiance in the restaurant is warm and friendly, the staff are kind and welcoming.   I always get the personal pizza with my own selection of toppings and have never been disappointed. It's my first choice for pizza in Edinburgh by a landslide!   I've also tried the Nachos and the brownie dessert, both were absolutely delicious and I will probably order them again as well.   We've showed up so many times the staff have started to recognize and joke around with us, which enhances our dining experience. Every server I've encountered has been an absolute pleasure.   Five stars for the quality of service, quality of food, and prime location!",

They don't have a full menu of pizza options but rather a dozen options and then a list of all the toppings you can put together in any combination you want. This is not so good for indecisive people like me as it gives me too many possibilities. The pizzas are good and come in a variety of sizes, the ruler on the back of the menu is especially usefully.   The tables are very close together so expect your neighbouring tables to be able to overhear your conversation and you to be able to overhear theirs.  They do gluten free pizzas and beer which are apparently awesome according to my gluten free friend.",

    "text": "We went here for a free event for toddlers during the food & wine festival. The event was very impressive, my toddler got to make a pizza from scratch all by herself and all for free! The wee pizza makers (the event had about 13 kids) all had a blast.    The owner of the restaurant hosted the event and was extremely fun and entertaining. He did a really good job leading the kids through the steps to make pizza dough. We were so pleased by our experience that we stayed for lunch!   We split a medium pizza between 2 adults and wee one ate her tasty creation. Our pizza was definitely reminiscent of pizzas I've had in California. Very tasty! The crust is thicker than italian style but not deep dish like Chicago style, quite similar to NY slices. We really enjoyed the pizza and would def return.   It would be fun to go back and have a pizza making event! Or a special bday party where a lucky few could make their own pizzas!  Or just go and eat some pizza.  Either way you slice it you're gonna have some scrumptious pizza!",

We thought it would be a mixed bag during the Festival, but we were seated within minutes and the staff were very helpful and polite - which can often be hard to find in the city on a Saturday night - especially in the Grassmarket.  I was a bit disappointed with the lack of spinach on my pizza, and finding out after asking for more that I was charged for it. Also, they automatically add an optional 10% gratuity to the bill - however, if I ran a restaurant in the Grassmarket, I'd probably do the same.  Mamma's is the only pizza place I've seen that does a gluten free crust - which I'll definitely have to try next time.  Now to eat my left over pizza...",

So basically, you choose how big a pizza you want, what kind of sauce (spicy or mild) and then what toppings you want. The toppings list is pretty extensive, you can even request cactus or marshmallows on your pizza if you so wish, but I prefer the more conservative options :)  The pizza was delicious, base was not thin but not overly thick either - somewhere between a pan pizza and a thin pizza crust I guess. It was definitely crusty which I liked.   Service is friendly. And the music - oh I could come here just for the music :)",

The sauce was okay and distinct when I paid attention for it, but overall this was a \"just okay\" pizza. It's worth the price, but nothing exceptional. The staff and venue are both very nice though.",
