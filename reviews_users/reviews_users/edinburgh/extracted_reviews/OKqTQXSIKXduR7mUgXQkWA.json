We did not have a reservation so they were kind enough to allow us to order take out. The food was amazing, hands down some of the best thai food I have ever eaten. We loved it so much, we came here twice during our week long stay in Scotland!",

    "text": "We had been sampling Thai food throughout the UK. Nok's Kitchen was solid - not a blow you away experience. We started with the crab curry \"cones\" and chicken roll. Chicken roll was dry - needed a bit of sauce. Crab \"cones\" were probably the best dish of the meal with seafood flavor backed by a nice curry flavor. For mains we split the panang curry (red) and soft shell crab curry (yellow). Both were solid - panang maybe a bit too much coconut milk mellowed out the flavor. Both didn't have a ton of depth and for 3 pounds would expect more rice because one wasn't enough to split. Good serve and overall experience!",

They said if we ate within the hour we could stay, SOLD!  Such tasty food, small place, friendly staff.  We had pad thai and a curry.  It was so good, especially after our long day out, really hit the spot.  Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Stockbridge- but make a reservation!",

Veg spring rolls, small, bland with store grade chilli dipping sauce. Chilli chicken was very battered and greasy also. Overall a fail. Will not be back.",

One of the best Tom Kha (coconut soup) and Tom Yum (hot & sour soup) I've ever had in my short life. It's unfortunate that I didn't get to try more, but on a cold windy and rainy night, those soups saved my life... I'm still craving/thinking about it three weeks later!  FYI - make a reservation, no matter the party size. The restaurant is average size but it gets packed really quick and there isn't exactly a waiting area.",
