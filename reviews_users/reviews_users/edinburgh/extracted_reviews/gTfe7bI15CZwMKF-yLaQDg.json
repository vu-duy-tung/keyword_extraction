    "text": "If the word 'kebab' conjures up images of disgusting greasy heart-attack-in-a-box 3am purchases, then you've go the wrong idea about this place.  Gourmet Kebabs is the sideline belonging to the people that own La Piazza, and the same high quality and attention to detail is applied by the bucketload.  My personal favourite is the Al Ferri, which is lamb marinated in rosemary and garlic, and comes with huge chunks of roasted peppers, aubergines and courgettes. It's only 6.50, and it was certainly filling! I also liked the fact that the lamb was really tender, and not all fatty and chewy like it so often can be.  But the best thing about this place are their sweet kebabs. They range from 3-3.50 so they're not exactly going to break the bank, and I highly recommend the Tropicale: mango, pineapple and banana chunks grilled and drizzled with caramel sauce. I'm actually salivating at the memory of it...  They do deliver, but they charge 1.50.",

    "text": "This place used to have a take away place on Gilmore Place called Abrakebabra or something and I always meant to go in and try as I liked the thought of a non greasy tasty and unusual kebab... It is now a delivery only company based in Shandwich Place and place and Edinburgh Road. We had a delivery 2 nights ago and the meal was bad. We shared a Vesuvio pizza which was massive!! Which was great but the dough was way too thick the chicken looked like stringy carrots and we had 3 slices of pepperoni on this massive 16\" pizza. All of the toppings were in the centre so it could really have been an 8\" pizza. We also ordered a lamb kebab which no one would eat due to the amount of salt in the sauce and the meat was really tough. Our pecan pie was tasty but my friend ordered onion rings as the photo on the menu had them looking fresh and tasty but when they arrived they were frozen and heated (iceland style). All in all the menu looks good and the portions are great, shame it just tastes rubbish. I wouldn't recommend. Shame.",
