Most important fact we all enjoyed.  Friendly, think it was run by a family, not a Scottish one, but that doesnt matter.",

    "text": "Auld Jock's Pie Shoppe is one of our rescue restaurants. On more than one rainy hungry day we have stumbled in here after being unable to eat at other Grassmarket restaurants (because our group was too large or we had a baby with us too late in the evening). The ambiance is casual and a little cramped, but the location is excellent and we've never been uncomfortably squished.   Their menu is centered on British classics- expect jacket potatoes, sausages and mash, and lots of pies. As you can guess from the name, the pies are definitely the highlight. I'm a fan of the classic steak and ale, but my husband loves the haggis version, and there is a solid heaping of mashed potatoes to go with it. The jacket potatoes are only okay, with toppings dumped on top and cheese often not fully melted. There's also a full case of cakes to tempt you after your meal, but as the portions (at least for meals and pies) are sizeable you may need to plan ahead or plan to take them home with you.   Overall, if you find yourself in need of a quick lunch or an open seat during a busy time certainly pop into this homey favorite!",

    "text": "I'd genuinely never spotted this place, despite walking past it thousands of times, until quite recently. It's just a wee place, with seating for maybe a dozen people. It's aimed squarely at the tourist market, but this is Edinburgh and tourism is rather important to our economy, so that's no bad thing, in itself.   The mash was defintely better than the pie, a haggis filled one, that I tried. Not a place I'll be rushing back, but if you have a longing for pie stodge, you could do worse that pop in here.  Overall, we said: \"the mash at Auld Jock's was the standout item. The rest of the experience wasn't quite so highlight packed. The place is quite tourist trappy, and for the quality on offer, it is a little pricey. I'm glad I acted upon my curiosity, after finally spotting this place, but I'm not sure I was rewarded richly enough to consider a repeat visit.\"",

    "text": "With a stereotypical name like 'Auld Jocks', I didnt hold high hopes for this odd little pie shop (or shoppe) at all.  Offering a huge range of things to eat, including scottish delicacies as Haggis 3 different ways (in a pie, with chips, or with neeps and tatties) you cannot complain that there wont be anything you fancy to eat.  Unfortunatly, the prices are rather high and the food rather dissapointing - lacking in taste and just a bit boring really.   However, this place was full - with people coming in to order food all the time, much to the credit of the one member of staff who I could see working her socks off.   Maybe then its just me, and I have missed the point of Auld Jocks Pie Shoppe - but I wasnt taken by this place.",

    "text": "Despite the comical name, Auld Jock had his work cut out from day one, as he's located just five minutes from Piemaker, perhaps the greatest place on Earth.  Jock puts up a bit of a fight admittedly, with decent pies and pastries, but the quality just isn't quite there, and it's a little bit steeply priced, considering Piemaker will do you a sausage roll for just 55p.  They have struck gold in one sense though, by doing delicious Mackie's ice-cream cones. I've found getting a decent ice-cream surprisingly difficult in this neck of the woods, so must give Auld Jock credit where credits due.",

    "text": "I'm not really a pie fan (unless we're talking apple pie here) but I found Auld Jock's too enticing to walk by and went in to sample some pie delights.  The shops is small with a seating area outside, although the tables and chairs were stacked up when I went and it looked like you might have to assemble your own seating area if you wanted to dine there.  I also expected the place to be stowed out with excited tourists but I was the only person in the shop at the time, and it was mid-afternoon lunch time. I decided to put on my tourist hat (well, I am from Glasgow) and try the traditional haggis pie, which was nice, although I am not a huge haggis fan so perhaps that put the pie at a slight disadvantage. It was bloody pricey too, I didn't leave with much change from a tenner for my lunch.   Good for tourists because it's cute and unique, probably not such a huge hit with locals.",
