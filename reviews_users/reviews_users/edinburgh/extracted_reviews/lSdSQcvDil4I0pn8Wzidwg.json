    "text": "Overpriced food that thinks it's way fancier than it really is.  My food looked like it arrived on a small blackboard, and I saw another table get their order (soup maybe?) in what looked like flower pots.  Use bowls and plates, goddamn.  Medium rare steak was too chewy and didn't feel like a proper medium rare.  Haggis bon bons had the smooth texture of raw meat inside the admittedly nice fried dough.  And for some reason when I asked for a water they gave (and charged me!) for a bottle instead of just giving me tap like a sensible place would.  Absolute robbers, this place.  It's on the same street as the Scran and Scallie and Taisteal and charging the same price for worse food.  Avoid.",
