I've only been to this one once and have had it bookmarked to return.  On my visit I had the homemade soup with a chicken wrap to sit in, and what I had was tasty, filling and very good value for money.

I came in for a coffee and (read: redeeming quality, I swear I am a good person) paid for a few extra coffees to pay it forward. Gosh I love the concept.   But the coffee was just AWFUL. I knew it the second the cup of burnt milk touched my hands and I couldn't hold it for longer than a few seconds without swapping hands. It was unbearable and I won't live my life drinking bad coffee. I went around the corner and threw it in the bin.   Its a fantastic concept really, but the coffee needs to be at least halfway decent. Nobody deserves to drink what I had in my burnt little hands.   I'm willing to give it another try, but I struggle to to believe one can bounce back from that- it wasn't an off day, it was an awful coffee.",

Social Bite is an awesome place, which supports an excellent cause.  The food is very good (most especially the millionaire shortbread), the staff was super-attentive, and the coffee was top-shelf.    We weren't sure at first about what kind of place we had walked into, but once we figured out the good deeds that Social Bites makes happen, we were glad to be a part of it :-)",

I have been here twice now, and the food has been great. The first time I had a chicken curry that was the special of the day. It was a big portion size and I probably wouldn't have complained if it was bigger since it tasted so good.   Most recently I took advantage of their lunch deal: soup + sandwich or wrap + piece of fruit for only 4.95. My chicken fajita wrap was tasty, but I most enjoyed the carrot and orange soup... so good.",

    "text": "Social Bite is an excellent initiative, as many people have already commented. Like any cafe, it serves a selection of sandwiches, soups, hot drinks, salads etc. The difference is you can also buy an extra item or two which will later be given to a homeless person who needs something to eat. On top of this, any profits the place makes will go towards good causes related to the homeless.  I visited with my mother and sister, and between us we had a sandwich, noodles, crisps, water, rocky road, and hot chocolate. The food was largely good, apart from the noodles, which were watery and disappointing. Hot chocolate was excellent, and had a Christmas Tree crafted into it. Excellent! At the end of the meal, we also purchased a soup and sandwich for a homeless person. The staff were all friendly and helpful. I understand many workers here were themselves homeless in the past.   I can see why George Clooney visited Social Bite recently. The place is excellent, and clearly committed to its good work. 100% of the profits go to the homeless, the food is good, and the staff are very nice. Check it out.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to visit this place for some time now. It is basically a sort of sandwich shop/cafe, but as they state on their website: 'But the main difference between social bite and the rest is that 100% (every single penny) of profit goes towards solving social problems. This is not a token gesture. This is not a PR spin. This is just a different kind of business. A business to help others. This is a Social Business.'   So I went here today to do my bit and get a saintly lunch! They have such a wide range of delicious sounding salads, wraps, sushi, noodles, paninis, sandwiches, and hot food. I chose the Chorizo, Pear and Manchego Cheese panini. The staff were absolute sweethearts and the panini turned out to be absolutely delicious!   Unfortunately, just after I bought my panini I noticed their pie menu on the wall and had major food envy. Their pies so absolutely mouth watering, but that's OK, it just means I have to go back soon to try one! :)  I paid slightly more (3.99) than I normally would for a panini, but the ingredients were delicious and fresh and off course my money was going to help others so I am more than happy to pay a bit extra!  I strongly recommend this place and I'll be back there very soon. They also offer loyalty cards which is a good incentive to keep going back.",

Sandwiches, paninis etc are all delicious, and along a similar line to Pret in terms of choices and price.  They're not cheap, but they're not outrageously expensive and at least you know your money is going to a good cause.  They do excellent pies too, which come with peas, mash and gravy, and I've noticed they now have a cereal bar too for anyone hungry at breakfast time.  Good food and good causes.",

Not only are the sandwiches delicious, but they give 100% of their proceeds to  charitable causes in Edinburgh and around the world. They serve local products and make an attempt to be an environmentally friendly restaurant. They are very supportive of the community. On the counter, they have a basket in which you can put change and money and all if it goes to provide sandwiches for the homeless that need something to eat. I put 4 in and the cashier explained to me what the money went to. I just wish I had more to give! Another wonderful thing they do is give opportunities to those who need them- they proudly display that 1 in 4 of their employees are previously homeless. I can't think of a better place to get a meal and give back to the community at the same time. I just wish other cities would follow suit in this wonderful idea.",
