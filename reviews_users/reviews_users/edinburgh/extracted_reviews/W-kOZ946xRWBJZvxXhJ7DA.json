Price wise - around 25 a head without wine - it's a bit pricey but worth it for a special occasion. If you like sushi and you haven't been yet, its well worth a visit. Being close to the Lyceum and Traverse it's a great place to go for a pre-theatre visit as service is quick. Recommended!",

Atmosphere of this restaurant is quiet and Servers are kind and smile. I order two rolls, several nigiris but grain of rice is worse than what i anticipated. Kind of sake prepared is not various. But considering this is Edinburgh, small city,  far from London, it is not bad for Japaneses food.",

    "text": "edinburgh is a city of many things, but for the first few years i lived here it lacked a good sushi restaurant.  which clearly made me very sad as sushi is one of my most favourite meals out!  it's like japanese tapas!  but thankfully kanpai opened just over two years ago and solved my sushi dilemma.  this past friday the boyfriend decided to treat me to dinner as he was abandoning me to go away skiing for a week.  so naturally i suggested kanpai because we hadn't been for sushi in ages and bonus i wasn't paying!  even though we phoned ahead to book a table we still didn't manage to get one until 8:30pm on friday night, so this place is very popular.  i'm a bit surprised by its popularity as every other time i've been most of the tables were full but they were never super busy.  i always thought it was due to them being tucked down a side street near the lycuem theatre, so off the main road and less passerby traffic.  but clearly the secret is out as the place was absolutely packed!!  we ordered a selection of rolls to share: spicy tuna, dragon roll, rainbow roll, teriyaki salmon roll and then miso soup and vegetable tempure.  i was starving so super happy that the rolls began appearing at our table with speed!!  all the rolls were delicious, i especially enjoyed the teriyaki salmon roll.  we'd never had it before but the just cooked salmon on top of an avocado roll with a teriyaki glaze was like a tiny bite of sushi heaven.  it just went together so incredibly well i almost wish i hadn't been sharing it!!  the dragon roll is equally delicious and also like a work of art.  it arrives at your table with flair, thin slices of avocado layered on top of a tempura prawn roll complete with the head stuck to the wooden plate.  the vegetable tempura was tasty and different in that it wasn't pieces of veg in tempura batter, but little bunches of shredded veg deep fried with a tasty dipping sauce.   the service in kanpai is equally attentive and non intrusive all at the same time.  the wait staff are quick to take your order and bring your drinks, but don't hover over you as you eat your food.  they also clear plates quickly although they were a bit slow getting the bill to us.  i'm assuming this was due to them being so busy so not really their fault.  so five star sushi dining experience!!  i love this restaurant and apparently so do all the young hip rich people of edinburgh as there appeared to be a very large number of them dining with their designer hand bags next to them.  while this may put some people off, i like pretending to live in the world of the rich and no one will stop me from getting my sushi!",

    "text": "We went here for a belated (US)  Mothers day dinner. Originally we wanted to go for lunch but, the hours are a bit wacky and they aren't open for a gap in the evening so we settled for an early dinner. The staff were really nice, the hostess, a young lady seemed very interested in our wee one and even though they had no child seats they were very accommodating and put us in our table where she could sit in the pram and not be in the way.   I ordered the miso soup, chicken veg dumplings and grilled eggplant. We shared the veg tempura. My partner had the panko crusted salmon sushi and the buckwheat noodle starter. I was very happy with what I ordered. The dumplings were tender and pan seared to perfection. The miso soup was deliciously balanced and a great starter. If you didn't know this, miso soup is traditionally eaten in Japan at the start of a meal, to open ones appetite! The grilled eggplant was AMAZING. Just thinking about it makes me feel hungry. I have never tasted anything quite like it, a bit salty and sweet all grilled and cut like a mango! The tempura was the the only mediocre thing I ordered. I thought it was a bit stodgy, tempura is meant to be light fluffy deep fried goodness. This seemed to be a mashed up medley of vegetables deep fried then cut into triangular shapes. It would have been better if they were smaller and not so smooshy. Now my partners fare is another story, I was not a fan but he seemed to enjoy it enough.  All in all I was quite impressed. I will definitely be coming back though it would be great if they actually got some child seats! Also keep an eye on their opening hours! But do go, you won't regret it.",

I had reserved a table for a party of 6 and become one of those customers I hated, having to call and ask if we could be late. They were absolutely fine with it and when we did arrived they showed us to a private little alcove with a long table. It was far to big for 6, and inspired, I asked if a few more friends could join. (Also doing something a customer never should!) And they were completely fine with it. The service was fantastic and the food just as amazing as the last time. We had quite a rolling dinner between 6 of us and we tried so many yummy things. Again, the eggplant was a winner as was the dragon roll and the Kanpai special roll. I have to compliment them on how accommodating they were despite us being naughty dinner guests. It is a wonderful place to take a larger party and a completely fun dining experience!",

The nice thing I love about Japanese is that I always feel stuffed but it's also been a much more healthy experience than say eating the same weight of burgers or 'dogs - plus some green tea on the side really makes it feel like some sort of deep cleansing experience!   So we went and checked out Kanpai while in Edinburgh last week and this was a fantastic dining experience. It was lunch time so the atmosphere wasn't exactly electric but the good news was that we sat in the private booth that fits 8 people in the back - a really nice setting and relaxed place to enjoy a leisurely lunch.  The staff were super friendly, the venue traditionally decorated and the soft shell crab maki I has was fantastic. The aubergine, seaweed and gyoza were also super tasty as starters! Wow - I wish I could eat it all again right now...   The only thing I have to say is that they didn't seem to have quite a few menu items which puts it down to a 4 star for me. A sushi restaurant should really have the core ingredients like Tuna at all times.",

The food was superb and although more expensive than most it was excellent value for money in both quality and portion size.

    "text": "The previous reviews led me to expect something special here, and from the food perspective, I wasn't disappointed.  I must admit that I was a bit underwhelmed at first. It looks lovely from the outside but upon entering I felt that the decor leans a bit more towards office waiting room than Japanese minimalist, and it was also rather chilly inside. After perusing the menu, we began ordering the first of our two dishes containing tuna, and discovered that they were out of tuna. A Japanese restaurant out of tuna? That's like a chippie running out of haddock! I really wanted to try the seared tuna with miso dressing but maybe next time.  But. The food we had was fantastic, definitely a cut above your usual sushi chains. We each had miso soup then we shared grilled dumplings, salmon maki, bean curd nigiri, mackerel nigiri, sea bream nigiri and prawn nigiri. The delicate seasoning on the sushi rice, the way the nigiri held together, the delicious dumplings, the depth of the miso soup. Everything was top drawer.  Sushi can be an expensive lunch, especially if you're starving to begin with, and Kanpai costs about 20% more than other places. We spent 35 for lunch (= the dishes listed above plus a beer each) and could have eaten more. But with Japanese food you get what you pay for. I'm not sure I can afford going back for lunch but I will definitely return for dinner and just order course after course until I'm stuffed. The sashimi platter for two has to be tried and I really want to taste that seared tuna.",

The only drawback is that, when they are busy, the small staff can't handle the volume and service can be inexcusably slow. They need to hire more staff or something, because I always want to come here but, if I see it pretty full next time I will turn away and try something else. I highly recommend the sesame seaweed salad, the grilled salmon nigiri, the mackerel nigiri, the spicy salmon roll, and the (enormous) futo maki. omg, my mouth is literally watering thinking about it.",

It is usually completely wonderful, but the last time I was there something was going on with staffing because the staff were EVERYWHERE and NOWHERE at the same time.  Filling glasses of water when they didn't need filling and completely walking away when we had to add to our order or pay the bill. They were incredibly disorganised on that one occasion which is UNCHARACTERISTIC for Kanpai. It must have been a bunch of new staff, because I've never seen anything like it. It became amusing because it was so bad. Kanpai staff are every single other occasion reserved, polite, available exactly when you need them, scarce when you want privacy, and above all, very dignified and knowledgeable. I will forgive them that one night because it was clearly something that had happened and not their usual groove. Their fish: I love the grilled scallop sashimi, the eggplant dish that they make, their tempura is perfection, all of the tuna is gorgeously pink, the gunkan are beautiful and delicious, their seafood salad is great value and delicious, all of their special rolls are good and beautiful to look at. I could go on. Everything here is good. You'll pay more for it, but you'll be happy you did.",

This lovely little sushi joint is, as me and Jenny were discussing, what I imagine they would be like in New York or London, snazzy, clean, welcoming, modern, fresh.... need I go on? The staff were incredibly welcoming and the menu is good.... although the only thing they are lacking is 'specials', I find they always tend to be an utter treat! But apart from that, this place is like gold dust. We decided that we would share a few wee plates so we had Spicy Tuna Gunkan Nigiri, Grilled Aubergines in Miso, Chicken and Vegetable Dumplings and Grilled Teriyaki Salmon Maki. They were all simply scrumptious..... I probably could have eaten more out of sheer gluttony, but this was just enough for the two of us.   Ok, so if you have got this far you quite clearly are a sushi eater in Edinburgh, so give it a go! The price is no more than anywhere else in town even though it feels more 'upmarket'. Quite simply a brilliant lunch out.",

I decided since it's so close to my hotel I might as well give it a shot and I'm so glad I did. It's off a side street (right down from Nando's) so it's a little hidden but once you step inside you're in another little world. The sushi here looked somewhat standard on the menu but when my order arrived I was pleasantly surprised. My favorite was the Kanpai roll, which I think I'll have to get again while I'm in town.  It'd be a nice little date spot (saw several couples there) but seems good for a casual option as well. The staff is very friendly and welcoming all around.  I haven't tried any other sushi spots in Edinburgh so I only have my experiences in the States to compare this place to, but from my first experience was a really good one. I highly recommend giving this place a shot.",

    "text": "I think I may have fallen in love with the food from this restaurant. I've been here three times in as many weeks and I still want to go back for more. Quite simply this is the best sushi restaurant I've ever eaten in.    From the outside Kanpai is pretty understated. It's actually easy to miss as the signage and door outside are plain; it's only as you pass the window by the sushi bar where you can see chefs preparing the food that you get an impression of some of the magic happening inside. In all the times I've visited it's always been busy inside which is yet another indication of its growing popularity. I wouldn't dream of just walking in and hoping they have a table. Booking in advance, especially if you want to eat between 7pm and 8:30pm, is advisable, though you can usually get a table the same day if you can be flexible with your time.   But to the star of the show, the food! Frankly there aren't enough superlatives to describe how incredible the food is. I think quite a few of my friends have become addicted to the miso glazed aubergine they serve here. The tempura batter they make is so light and crispy that you usually end up making a mess biting in to it as it flakes everywhere. The sharing sushi rolls are probably my favourite. At eight pieces each I'm still undecided if I could actually just eat one to myself but then I wouldn't have room for anything else. The Tokyo roll is filled with chicken which was unexpected in a sushi restaurant (most of us would associate sushi with fish right?) but absolutely delicious! The dragon roll is also a firm favourite, with tempura prawn and avocado, the chefs will often make the dish look like a nessie monster on your plate. The raw fish dishes with the nigiri taste fresh and are a nice accompaniment to the larger sushi rolls as they come in much smaller servings. It's also worth noting that my cup of green tea was never empty. They staff are constantly topping up your tea throughout your meal with a nice matcha blend that goes really well with the food if you aren't having wine.    I honestly don't have a bad thing to say about the place. The only gripes I would have is that the place is just too damn popular for its own good. It is also a little too pricy to be somewhere I would eat regularly (she says after being three times in three weeks.) but I suppose that is the price you pay for exceptional quality and sushi that makes your taste buds hum with delight.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews that this is the best sushi place in town I decided to try it out.  Here's the bottom line:  This is a good solid sushi restaurant. It may well be the best sushi place in town, but it certainly does not rank among the world's great sushi restaurants.    The fish was fresh, but not very flavourful and it sort of dissolved in your mouth quickly.  There was surprisingly not a wide array of sushi options. What they do offer is fairly simple - not very many novel or complicated combinations.  If you've never had sushi before, this is a good place to try it for the first time.  It is a popular place - so make sure you book in advance.  And if you come during the evening rush don't expect quick service. Everyone was very polite, but it took half an hour for us to get our bill.  That being said I would come back.  This is a quality, albeit slightly pricey sushi restaurant.  If I'm in Edinburgh for a long period of time I will stop by again.  But it made me long for a few of my favourite sushi restaurants back in the States where the fish is of higher quality, the combinations are more innovative, and the prices are cheaper.",

    "text": "This is definitely the best sushi restaurant in town. As a native Californian, Edinburgh has left me craving sushi badly, and this place is the only one that scratches the sushi itch.  The food is fabulous quality, the fish is extremely fresh and good, and the cooked items on the menu are also incredible (definitely try the dumplings). The staff are extremely, almost officiously, friendly and polite, and are very attentive throughout your meal.  My only complaints are that the menu is a bit simple (not a lot of diversity in the offerings like you see in some sushi places) and they're a bit stingy with the fish. Their hand rolls have only a very tiny bit of fish in them, whereas I'm used to hand rolls that are about 90% fish with a bit of other stuff thrown in. Their sushi rolls are very good, but I don't order them anymore because they're very heavy on rice and other things, like avocado, and have too little fish to even really taste it. Now I just get sashimi so I can actually taste the fish.",

    "text": "Well, this is rather awkward.  If you've read my recent Review of the Day, you'll know that I am very, very, fond of Tang indeed. Before any accusations come my way, let me remind you, Gentle Reader, that I have never (with any sobriety) promised a wholly exclusive relationship with Tang alone.  Having said that, I have taken Kanpai as my mistress and Holy salmon Batman I am now seriously considering polygamy. I think we are all agreed, my fellow Yelpers, that Edinburgh sucks for sushi. But not Kanpai, it is abundant in awesomeness and the cold dead fish here possesses the two qualities valued above all others in such commodities: it being very cold and only very recently deceased.   The ebi tempura is ridiculous. It comes in a tiny wicker basket, with it's own little sprinkle of herbs and we ordered three (!) three of those baskets. One after the other. And on an entirely unrelated note, the waiting staff is not at all judgmental and very discreet. Even if you decide to order half the menu twice over. (And you will).  Tang is good, it really is, but Kanpai is luxury. That is the prime difference between the two. Tang has all the makings of a good sushi restaurant, but go on a weekday and you'll find they will have no sushi chef in-house and the quality of the fish will be markedly different than on the weekends.  Kanpai cuts no corners. Kanpai cuts fishies, yes, but only good ones. It takes itself seriously and because of that it's the type of restaurant where you can truly celebrate a special occasion.   Though in all honesty, should I ever win the lottery, I'll have them set up a little table in the corner just for me alone. Behind a screen of course. As I intend to order more then three of those tiny wicker baskets and then whisper quietly from behind my screen \"Here fishy, fishy, fishy.\"   Now if you'll excuse me, I have some squid to catch.",

    "text": "Yesterday I organised to have lunch with a friend andddddd our brand-new community manager Jody B! We wanted to try out Kanpai, a place which many locals rave about, yet I have shamefully not yet set foot in the place.  Upon entering however we were given some bad news, apparently the restaurant was booked up for lunch! After briefly walking away and contemplating going elsewhere we decided to go back and try out our persuasive powers... We got lucky and the waiter added a chair to a table set for two.   The menu was in itself beautiful, a floral scroll painting; this gave me high hopes for its actual content. There were not many options, especially for me as a vegetarian, but  this made me think the menu chose quality above quantity. I knew from the start that I would be ordering the famous miso aubergine, but also got some avocado maki on the side. They could do with a few more inventive veggie rolls as what was available was pretty basic, but well done.  The miso aubergine was the star of the lunch, it literally melted in my mouth and the sweet miso sauce was delicious. It was presented very delicately on a grid above a thinly grated carrot bed. The sushi was as it should have been, but was perhaps a little pricy at 4.20.  Book in advance, expect good but expensive food, order the aubergine.",

    "text": "Kanpai is so unassuming from the outside I thought I was in the wrong place.  Kanpai had been on my list for a long time and my friend finally obtaining her PhD was the perfect excuse for sushi! So at 7pm last Tuesday, 20 of us rocked up ready to get our sushi on!  Inside, Kanpai's Japanese style decor looks like a bar more than a restaurant. particularly since you will be greeted by people lined up sitting at the 'bar' with their sushi.  The service is excellent, our waiters and waitress were so polite and perfectly efficient. They took the order for twenty people and didn't make a single mistake, despite the questions and last minute changes.  Our food arrived promptly and the kitchen must have working overtime because everyone's dish came at around the same time, so no one person was waiting hungrily (as I've experienced in so many Asian restaurants!)  When my Dragon Roll arrived I was heard to loudly announce 'I'm so happy', much to the amusement of those seated around me. I was soooo happy though, avocado, prawn tempura and such a fantastic presentation! I also ordered mixed vegetable tempura which was original in that, instead of cut vegetables individually tempura'd I received grated vegetables mixed together and deep fried into little pyramid shapes. Everyone's food looked amazing and I am going to have to return to try that massive sashimi special (2 people? please....)  My only negative comment is that a sushi restaurant should not run out of tuna...ever...unfortunately Kanpai had. Though alternatives were offered, which is fantastic and much better than just taking the dishes off the menu altogether, I'm not sure it really made up for the lack of yummy tuna sashimi my tummy was craving.  Also, the wines on offer are delicious!",

    "text": "Fantastic ! Where do I even begin...   - Sushi: Every roll of sushi is a masterpiece! The combination of flavours in every single roll is phenomenal. The display and elegance of both the roll cross section and plate are fantastic and add tremendously to the already great experience.  Ingredients are fresh, seaweed is crispy, fish is tender, vegetables are crunchy and the rice is tasty. The soy sauce they provide is perfect as it is not too strong and salty and therefore does not obscure any of the lovely flavours.  To choose a favourite is very hard but I will say that the most distinct ones were: The Dragon Roll, Rainbow Roll and grilled Teriyaki Salmon Maki. Don't let the simplicity of the grilled Teriyaki Salmon Maki fool you... the taste, texture and combination of flavours are just perfect !   - Hot/cold dishes: Again the display is fantastic and elegant. I generally like eating sushi in places like this, but I had some other dishes and they were super. Lots of flavours and textures that work very well together. From the dishes I have tried I would highly recommend the Grilled aubergine in sweet miso sauce, and just so you understand how good it was, I generally don't like aubergine dishes at all....  The Teppan Teriyaki Salmon and the Tempura veg and king prawn were also very good. Sashimi on ice was a very beautiful display and the sea foods were nice and fresh.   - Atmosphere and Service: Everything in the restaurant is high quality. Tables, chairs, cutleries, Sushi chef bar and even the soy sauce dispenser was a nice traditional pot. The overall atmosphere was elegant and relaxing. Service is kind and extra polite just like traditional asian hospitality, FANTASTIC. Prices are fair for what you get and is a great evening out with a partner, close family and friends.  I really cant think of anything negative to say after about 20+ visits to this restaurant.    Enjoy!!",

Between us we ordered a variety of dishes, including edamame, wakame salad, avocado rolls, dragon roll, miso eggplant, and some sashimi. Everything was good, but I can't point to any item that was really a stand-out. The eggplant was very tasty but too oily.

    "text": "Kanpai..we meet again. .  I remember when Kanpai first opened. It was introduced to me by a friend knowing the owner of it.  At the time she was the owner of Sushiya and then she opened Kanpai.  Not sure about now though.    So being recommend by a friend and big lover of Japanese food...again I mentioned...went along...location wise its quite hidden away...and I walked in..wow..so much bigger compare to Sushiya....sat down ...immediately opened the menu ...  Tokyo roll, softshell crab roll, tempura roll, rainbow roll and dragon roll. Oh and california roll.   All excellent.  Not one problem I had with their maki. I was guessing maybe their tempura roll might not be so good? Coz its extremely tricky to get the batter right for tempura.  And it was excellent.   Was very disappointed when they told me they dont serve ramen or udon or even hot food...which really confused me...coz u need hot oil to fry tempura no? And..I can order teriyaki beef thats hot no? Anyway she said if I want ramen I can try sushiya...there was a long awkward pause there...  So I went for the teriyaki beef which came in stunning presentation.  Beef sitting on a candle lit...burner thing...the portion was small compare to the price. First thing got to me was...is that a real leaf??? Wont it be burnt sitting on top of the tea light. ...but my friend sitting opposite me reassured me saying \"of course it won't!! They must have tried this many times don't be stupid must be some kind of fire safe leaf looking thing....blah blah\" so I thought. .mm..ok..he must be right.   But guess what..the leaf did burn....and we were embarrassingly stuffing our mouth and plate with beef so they could remove the burning leaf...in fact...I put some water on it...it was not a big massive flame but yep...not the special kind of waterproof leaf atall..  Overall the food was excellent, service was good too the waitress was so apologetic but hey they just opened back then...I believe they must be doing so well now coz they got high ratings..the place was very clean...definitely somewhere good to take your friends family or business.",

    "text": "Occasionally, not often, but occasionally, I MUST give a terrible review for an amazing place. What I mean by that is I'm not going to review Kanpai 'cause it's the BEST, but only relatively.  If you go sushi - Go Kanpai... because everywhere else pretty much sucks.  Why? Because Edin-f**king-burgh a city of 400,000 and people from all over the WORLD, first class universities, the home of some of the greatest writers of all time and home of the Edinburgh Fringe has the worst f**king sushi this side of the Mid-West of the US. Scotland... you're ON THE WATER. There is no excuse for such a piss poor showing of choice in sushi restaurants.   Which is why Kanpai is *FIVE GIANT STARS* hands down. It is one of the only sushi places that surpasses supermarket sushi in this little city. The choices are amazing and it will satisfy anyone who loves them some raw fish on a plate (and even cooked fish on a plate). It ain't cheap, but it ain't more expensive than anywhere else. There's not nearly enough 'Bento Box' choice, but still, it far surpasses any and everything I have tried in Edinburgh.   Don't even attempt anywhere else if you have any choice in the matter.",

We tried many items from the sushi to their nigiri (eel, salmon & sea bass), the aubergine teppanyaki, tuna tartare etc and all were beautifully presented, fresh and flavoursome, I would highly recommend visiting this authentic Japanese restaurant. The wine list had some good accompaniments too.  You can choose to sit at the counter watching the sushi chefs at work or at a table.  The waiter was so polite and friendly, it just reminded us so much of the dignity & politeness of Japanese culture too. A wonderful experience overall!",

But I'd be damned if I wasn't making the most of one of my favourite cities. Guided by yelp and gurgling hungry stomachs, we couldn't face greasy, and really fancied japanese. Wander down the quiet cobbled street and find this place, child, with excellent service, clean decor, and really tasty food.   Glasses of water and iced tea, which was marvellous, although the first over eager gulp filled me with fear of being reacquainted with my paradise palms buckfast daiquiris, and whatever takeaway i'd gobbled with my fingers, after losing my fork and not caring a smidge.   Even the menus are pretty, and it takes a while to go through them, so much choice. On a little table, we intended to sample, and share. They suggested we kept a menu with us, and we needed it.  We filled our table, twice, salads, crab, aubergine, beef, rolls, nigiri, the works, and every morsel was lovely.  Extra kudos for curing my terrible hangover.",

We quickly ordered some dishes and they came out in no time, very fresh and yummy. The wakame seaweed salad was so good, I could eat a big bowl of that. Veggie sushis were very nice and my husband's tuna and and dumplings were nice too. I didn't like the soba dish with some dipping sauce that I found quite sickening, it was like a sweet mayo sauce. My husband liked it though. I wish we had time to order the aubergine that everyone seems to love.  Definitely the place to go for Japanese food in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "It was a Saturday and I thought \"Time to treat myself to something delicious\" so OF COURSE I chose sushi! I noticed Kanpai while on my way to Mademoiselle Macaron (practically next door to each other) and Yelped it immediately when I had the chance. Behold, a popular Japanese place that I NEEDED to try! Perfect!  Went over for lunch and was quickly welcomed by friendly staff members. I sat at the sushi bar because I wanted to intimidate the chefs while they made sushi (hahahaha it's really a hobby of mine to make people feel uncomfortable). I also like when they finish making your food and immediately serve it to you over the bar, it feels more prompt and efficient lol  The space is beautiful! Very minimal and stylish, just like how Japanese restaurants should be. It was bright, clean and welcoming at the same time.   Anyway, I ordered a miso soup, salmon sashimi, soft shell crab maki and some green tea to go with everything (altogether, I paid 21.50quid). The miso soup was a good way to start the meal along with my freshly sliced salmon sashimi served in a bowl of shaved ice! Uggghhh so perfect with wasabi and soy sauce! My heart was exploding with happiness! The soft shell crab maki was delicious too! The crab was freshly fried up and then made into sushi right in front of me so props for freshness! :-) I was so full at the end of the meal, I could take a nap at the restaurant itself!   Overall, loved eating here! Was one of my favourite places to have been lucky enough to discover! Definitely will bring Gian here when we get a chance to visit Edinburgh again! :-D",

    "text": "The former Vancouverite is reviewing a sushi place in Edinburgh...  RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!  Folks, Edinburgh has many a thing going for it over wee ol' Canada. For one, there's a castle in the middle of the city. For second, you can drink whisky cheaply and stare at that castle to your heart's content. So when I was told i'd have to give up some of the best sushi outside of Japan for castles, whisky and great pubs (#3), it wasn't a difficult choice. I'm here aren't I?  But I didn't quite realize how quickly the sashimi cravings would kick in and so i've been systematically scouring the city for sushi spots. I've entered most apprehensively and here's what I've learned:  Edinburgh actually has some darn respectable sushi joints.  You'll just pay out the nose for that fact.  I had the pleasure of hitting this little sushi spot with Elizabeth G this afternoon and I must say, of the respectable joints in town, Kanpai is one of the best.  Here's what you need to know:  1. Make a reservation. Because even if it's 1pm, you might not get in. We quite literally had to beg to squeeze three bodies at a two person table to get our sushi fix in.  2. Order the eggplant... I mean, aubergine. It's delicious. You will not want to share this.  3. Don't expect me not to call it eggplant. It's only been a month folks. I'm learning slowly.  4. The rainbow roll is excellent. I went with this as a failsafe. I was personally craving sashimi, but if you're in a new sushi spot and don't know how good it's really going to be, that can be a risky order. The rainbow roll was topped with tuna & salmon sashimi and it was delectable. I really should have trusted my fellow Yelpers on that one.  5. Expat bonus tip: Don't convert the dollar amounts in your head. Yes, it's True - this place is pretty darn pricey, and definitely won't make a good pit stop day to day but it IS worth setting aside some dough and popping in every so often. The quality is worth the price and it is truly the best place i've been so far.  Castles. Whisky. Passable sushi. Edinburgh, you're stuck with me now.",

    "text": "I believe this review is relative to what you're accustomed to, but I've lived in the UK long enough to miss good sushi... and I'm from Georgia, not exactly the sushi capital of the US.  That said, I have to say that I've been pretty much shocked at the \"meh\" factor of most sushi places I've tried in the UK... I'm sure there are hidden gems, but I've hit so many duds in my quest that I subconsciously have started avoiding one of my favourite food types.  So, on to Kanpai... it's good, really good... good enough that it's getting five stars because I simply haven't had sushi this good on this side of the pond yet, and it's reasonably priced.  If you're over from Japan (or even California) I'm not sure it would rock you're world, but if like me you've grown cold to sushi because it's always either far overpriced, simply not good, or worse... both, then bookmark this place and give it a go.  The King Prawn Tempura... wow, it's a must for a starter, a real treat. I've had the Squid Tempura as well, and while also nice it didn't quite live up to the King Prawn Tempura... which is a bit of a surprise to me since I normally fall on the side of squid when playing favourites between the two.  I've also had the Grilled Aubergine in sweet Miso Sauce and it packed a punch with flavour... it could have almost been a dessert!  I've also had the Pan Fried Veg & Chicken Dumplings on two occasions, loving them the first time... sadly the second time, while still good, they didn't live up to the first visit... they came out a bit cold and the dipping sauce was a bit weaker in flavour.  (They were still good, just not as good.)    (Side note... if you're in London, near Angel, seriously try the dumplings at New Culture Revolution... they're handmade bits of win, no other way around it.)  I've had a few of the rolls at Kanpai, but so far the Dragon Roll is probably the winner in presentation and taste... I don't think you could really go wrong with any of them that sound of interest to you.  The Kanpai Special Combo is a win for sashimi taste and presentation... go with a friend and order one of these, a Dragon Roll, and have the King Prawn Tempura as a starter (I'll let you pick the second starter on your own... it's your dinner after all!) and your table will look like a presentation fit for a magazine.  So search no more Dear Yelpers, there is now somewhere I honestly look forward to going for sushi... not in the \"well, it will do\" way that so many other places have been until now... I legitimately crave this place.  For the place itself... it's almost hidden, with no sign jutting out, but clean and well laid out inside... the staff are courteous as well, but it can get quite busy... a booking on a busy night is wise... very wise indeed.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Treated myself to dinner here last week for my birthday. Given its reputation as supposedly Edinburgh's \"posh\" sushi restaurant I certainly expected to pay more for the meal than it actually cost so that was welcome but by the same token I was surprised that my booking wasn't registered. A seat was found for me at the bar though so face was saved.  Service-wise things were middle-of-the-road - not too slow but not overly attentive either. The food I had was on a par with most other sushi places I've been to in town so there was nothing really to set it apart in that sense although the teppan-yaki aubergine was a new one on me (& very moreish although I'd ask for a spoon to scoop it out with next time).   First impressions are though important so on top of the booking error there was also the rather tired menu to contend with. Outwardly it's very pleasing to the eye but inside the pages look tired and well thumbed, a dish no longer offered is merely sellotaped over with a strip of coloured paper and the last two pages are stapled together (presumably to hide other extinct dishes). A refresh of the booklet would be a good idea.",

    "text": "Kanpai definitely does the best sushi in Edinburgh. The menu is perhaps a little pricey, a little limited to sushi and sashimi, and I dont think you could leave full but despite that it is still excellent. The staff are really great too which is important for me as it really makes a dining experience when the staff are friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is really nicely laid out with a bar area where you can watch the sushi being made. I really enjoyed our sashimi selection and the dragon roll is lovely - plus it looks like a real dragon! Presentation here is exceptional and all the food looks like it should be on a photo shoot! I agree with Jenny on the aubergine, oh my word it is good, as it the soft shell tempura crab and the eel and surfclam too!  You definitely need to book in advance though as they get really busy but it is worth it.",

Brought the SO here even though she \"didn't like\" sushi, and she loved it. Even tried sashimi!   Recommended!   Also the staff are so lovely I want to take them home. Wait that sounds weird.",
