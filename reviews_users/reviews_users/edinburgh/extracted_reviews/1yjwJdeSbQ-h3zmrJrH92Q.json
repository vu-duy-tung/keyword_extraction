Yes, sadly the table was in the centre of the restaurant surrounded by all the other tables, but in the end, I was so impressed by the food that I totally forgot where I was sitting. It's really not a large place. The restaurant has about 8 tables with 2 tables of 4. Best you make a reservation on the weekend, as they seem very busy, no doubt. The clientele is more of the older upmarket generation with some young ones thrown in, who seem to enjoy a memorable evening out. Maybe for a special occasion, considering that this place is not cheap. Having said this, you definitely get your money worth of quality.  I ordered a fillet carpaccio with ruccola as a starter, veal in bread crumbs alla milanese (served with capers,  slices of lemon and anchovies) as a main and vanilla ice cream with amaretto as dessert. And yes, I still wonder how I ate it all :-)  Each of these dishes was served to its highest standards.  I still taste the soft and perfectly cut carpaccio with a hint of lemon or the amaretto touched vanilla ice cream perfectly proportioned.  The waiters were all Italian and efficient. Yes, we only got a two hours slot, but this was plenty. The food just kept coming. No delays, considering this place was packed.  The Prosecco was also Italian and of class! Not a brand I normally drink. I can definitely recommend this place for a nice evening out in general or for a special occasion.  And what's good? It's just opposite Haymarket.  Easy accessible for everyone!",

    "text": "This place has a very good reputation, as evidenced by the 5 star reviews from Kay L and Ann M.  It's very popular with locals, and is regularly busy, and we found it so on our visit. Dishes were accurate and tasty, but they weren't particularly outstanding. Their risotto lacked moisture, for me, and the pasta was good but not great. It's a very cute little place, though, and the service is very good, so it's worth a visit.  Overall, we said: \"La Bruschetta was a very decent local Italian. I understand why it attracts its loyal following. They have a sound and commendable commitment to serving fresh, local ingredients, but it would be lovely to see more innovation in their dishes, to raise things above \"solid and reliable\". For now, yes go and visit, but I'm not sure you'll be blown away.\"",

    "text": "Oh my lord, my tastebuds are still doing a wee happy dance - I've had the kind of food that makes you want to not pollute your mouth with anything substandard....  All that heralds one of the best Italian restaurants in Edinburgh is an inauspicious burnished red awning just across from Haymarket Station...  The kitchen is full of Italian voices and incredible smells; the restaurant is packed with regulars and locals, some speaking Italian to the wonderful old waiters, some simply enjoying an incredible meal.  Gamberoni with a side of spinacci fills my nostrils and, when I try it, it makes me chew slowly, making the \"I can't believe it's legal to eat this in public\" face.  The chicken dish is, apparently, orgasmic.  Happy faces (and tastebuds!) all round!  The spinacci was so simple and so good that it subsequently launched a google recipe search and repeated trips to Sainsbury's for ingredients over the following months while I perfected it.  I often think that good food allows you to guess at the ingredients but no one ingredient stands out as overpowering the others.  It should create a sensation that's like looking at a piece of art: you don't always see the brush strokes that create the whole piece.  La Bruschetta does this well.  The food made me want to re-learn the language just so I could appreciate all the nuance of it.  Like any (proper) Italian place, they're closed on Sunday and Monday, but it's well worth making a booking for a table at this wonderful wee piece of Italy.",
