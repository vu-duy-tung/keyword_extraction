We were carrying some trash that we hadn't been able to throw out yet. She told us we couldn't bring our own food into the cafe. She called the security guard on us and we had to show her that it was trash before we were allowed to stay.  This treatment was extremely rude and completely unacceptable in a service environment.   I do not exaggerate that it was less than a minute from when we walked in that she ran up to us shouting.    Do not eat here if you have the chance.   On top of the highly rude welcome, the tea was expensive and of poor quality. The medium was teabags and when a plate to put the teabags on was requested they said that they don't do that.  It seems that customer service is a foreign idea at this establishment.",

Booking was easy as the restaurants set up a contact for dealing with Christmas parties so I knew already we were in good hands. The menu looked amazing and booking was a breeze.   On the day we arrived in time to find the tables decorated with crackers. The food was brought out at a good pace, leaning towards slow. The staff were fantastic and great care was taken to make sure anyone with dietary needs was looked after.  Now, the food. Fairly darn phenomenal given the number of us! Everything was cooked to perfection and wonderfully arranged. The hits of the day were the amazing turkey and ham, and the divine chocolate pot! Though the duck, salmon and clootie dumpling aren't far behind.  Personally, I had the goose to start which was served with radish and an orange sauce. For mains I went with the duck, served with cabbage, potatoes and some delicious aniseed concoction. For afters I went with Clootie dumpling which was fantastically light (for dumping...) and tasty.   Everyone had a great time and there was so much room that our guffaws, hilarious secret Santa presents and general joviality didn't infringe on other patrons which was a nice plus.   I would definitely recommend any of the Contini restaurants for a Christmas meal!",

    "text": "When it was announced that my annual uni Chemistry Ball was to be held in the National Galleries, I had visions of us wining and dining along aside the artworks; a risky premise, I thought.   Of course, what I had forgotten was that there is a great wee cafe and restaurant underneath the galleries, which was where our ball was held. Previous venues included The George Hotel and Ghillie Dhu, so expectations were high.   Upon arrival (in quite a surreptitious manner - we had to be let in the side entrance by a member of council staff as the only entry, via Princes St Gardens, is otherwise locked up after 6pm) we were warmly greeted with glasses of Prosecco. So far, so good.   After a half hour cocktail reception we were allowed into the main restaurant area for our meal. With regards to decor, this place is classy and cosy; there are clear Scottish influences without being overwhelmed with tartan. I particularly liked the wee beakers that doubled up as candle holders - it's always the small details that impress me.   What I was most excited about, though, was the food (as per the norm). It was clear that this restaurant was all about promoting local produce, as there was a big board at the front explaining where all the key ingredients from the meal had come from.   By half 7, my tummy was rumbling, so I was delighted at the plentiful bread supply at the table with some oil dip. Maybe could have done with some butter or balsamic vinegar as well, if I was being picky. The bread was fresh and tasty and kept me going until the starter of fishcakes were served.  I'm not usually a fishcake-y person, but these were little round servings of haddock heaven complimented well with a lemon mayonnaise. Light and tasty - the perfect way to start a meal.   The beef that followed was also a winning choice. Only recently have I discovered how much more flavoursome red meat is when it's not cooked thoroughly. This cut, accompanied with a rich herby butter and tenderstem broccoli, was beautiful. And all this was atop of a lovely rosti. Simple, fresh, well-cooked.   By the time dessert came, I was a bit full. Still,  I was excited for the chocolate and orange pudding. And it looked lovely- a wine-glass full of chocolateness, topped with some pretty little flowery things (red cress? Is that a thing? I'm not quite sure what it was) and crunched honeycomb.   But I really struggled to get through it, and this is someone who has a mouthful of sweet teeth. It tasted delicious, don't get me wrong. It was, however, very rich - almost like eating a slightly melted cup of Terry's Chocolate Orange. Maybe if it had been in the form of a torte, with a bit of biscuit base action, it would have been a bit more stomachable.  Overall, though, a gorgeous meal in a sophisticated setting (and I take my hat off the the staff, who were discreet and efficient). Set us up for a night of ceilidh-ing and, latterly, boogie-ing, and was a lovely location for what was my final Chemistry Ball.",

The looked heavenly, and my boyfriend bought me one.  It was quite a bit bigger than usual cupcakes, and instead of buttercream, there was a thick double cream topping with numerous raspberries. It was really fresh, light, and hit the spot for sure. I'd love to return to try other flavours, yet alas, I didn't see anything gluten free.  I have drank tea in the main cafe before, and it is very spacious, service is good, the menu is traditional, yet at the same time very modern... If you get me... No empire biscuits, but mounds of fresh scones with various jams, herbal teas, good coffee. I may come back in to try a savoury dish, as the Scottish cafe often seems packed and is very popular with tourists and locals alike.   It's in a fantastic location, downstairs from the national gallery and princes street, overlooking Princes street gardens.",

I spent some time slurring at a waitress and she seemed nice too. Afterwards I wanted to get more drunk so I think that's basically a win for the venue!

We were allocated a great seat by the window which was good for people watching, with a great view of Princes Gardens.  I decided to opt for one of the light bites and ordered the open brie and chutney sandwich. When ordering the waitress asked if I would like a small mug of soup to accompany my sandwich which was a good shout. My sandwich was beautifully presented with a side salad, fresh grated beetroot and a small mug of spiced celearic soup. The flavours were amazing and my sandwich was quickly devoured.  I have been on a clean eating programme at the moment, so this felt like a real treat and we decided to just go all out and get dessert too since it was our only day off. Anyways I opted for a slice of homemade carrot cake and a cappucino. This is the first time I have been presented with a coffee with the restaurants logo presented in chocolate !  My carrot cake was great but I did experience some food envy when my friends petit fours arrived.  I really enjoyed my experience here and will def be back :)",

Really, Peter Irvine? Remind me to NOT trust your opinion again please.  While the service is top notch and the location is nice and super clean, the food selection leaves you a bit disappointed. I mean sure, being a vegan in Scotland is just STUPID but even so, if I did enjoy meat and cheddar and such, I would have still been underwhelmed by this menu. So toast and jam it was! At least their homemade preserves? Amazing.  The manager was willing to make me a hot toddy at 10am and that is definitely worth my respect. Note to everyone: climbing a mountain, in the winter and wind, in a skirt, is not a good idea. At least I can say I tried living it up like my ancestors.",

Regardless, we had a very pleasant meal (my husband ordered the same dish as the previous day (Scottish Breakfast) and I ordered the Smoked Salmon w/2 poached eggs & a bagel which was delicious.  The Bloody Mary's were also very tasty.  Only disappointment was that the heat was not working when we were there & unfortunately, it was a VERY cold & windy morning.  To top it off, we were seated by the windows & ended up eating our entire meal in our jackets b/c it was so cold.

They also sell a tasty range of freshly baked layer cakes, cupcakes, old fashioned ice-cream sundaes and afternoon tea.   Being a self-confessed sweet-tooth, I usually opt for a buttermilk fruit scone with strawberry jam or a bowl of their warming organic porridge with fresh berries and heather honey.

I just popped in for a coffee whilst I was waiting for a friend, but I spied things like sandwiches, soups and croissants etc on the menu if you're feeling peckish. There's not too much detail you can go into when describing a coffee, but it was piping hot and there was lots of foam on top of my cappucino. Those are usually my two grumbles, but no complaints here.

The next day, as we were exploring the city, we decided we wanted to try it out since we planned to check out the museum as well.   Mum had the fried haddock, chips, and mushy peas. The fish was perfect and lightly fried. Chips were chunky and mushy peas were delightfully sweet. I had the egg sandwich, which was nice and loads better than any Tesco sandwich. It could have use some sauce, as it was a little dry.  What sealed the deal is that we stumbled here on Mother's Day accidentally (Mother's Day in the US is on a different day than in the UK...) Mum was given a free glass of prosseco, and we were seated promptly with a fantastic view of the park and gardens on a lovely sunny day in Edinburgh.  5 STARS, fa sho!",

Okay, I'll stop, but are you with me here? Are you experiencing the joys of soft piano music, gentle hum of conversation and really, really good and honest food? If you are, good, if not, please walk down to this restaurant now and experience it.  I've only ever been in the day-time, both times relatively early though the closer to lunch the busier it gets, but I love this place.  This may be one of the few cafe/restaurants that I just enjoy the ambiance of because it is so ... so soft, so mild.   A minor disclaimer: children are not a good idea here, at least not inside, unless they are extremely quiet. It's a very quiet setting and since the ceilings are high, sound carries!  Fortunately, a lot of the patrons are nice old ladies, which invariable reminds me of Miss Marple, who come here to have their tea.  Ah, joy. No shouting, no harsh clinking cutlery sounds, just ... tea. And perhaps a scone or two.",
