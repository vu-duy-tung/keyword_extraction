Although the problems were minor and eventually resolved, it does make me feel this place is not worth more than three stars. I also find that the menu options for vegetarians/vegans are limited which is a real shame. Oh, if you order Tiramisu for dessert, then you're one lucky person if you actually end up with it. Out of the three times I've been, twice they'd run out of Tiramisu!! Finally please be aware that this restaurant gets very busy and on the weekend there's usually a queue. It pays to book a table!",

    "text": "Bella Italia is a chain Italian restaurant with various locations around Edinburgh.  This one on North Bridge seems to always be packed, I guess it attracts the tourists. The restaurant itself is nice enough while attempting to maintain authenticity. The staff are usually nice but the service can be a little slow due to how busy it is. But everything just seems a little bland and boring, as it is just another chain restaurant. It lacks the charm that those authentic little Italian restaurants have. The menu offers your standard Italian food, and if you look online you can usually find money off vouchers. Hence my reason for ever going. I usually end up getting a panini or burger, I know that isn't exactly Italian but looking at my dining partners pasta I have never been too impressed. And I like chips.   I will say that their \"Godfather\" dessert is pretty good. I am a sucker for fatty, chocolatey, ice-creamy desserts that come in big bowls and that does just that.   I would probably give this place a miss and head to one of the more authentic Italian restaurants because the food will be miles better.",

Upon being seated we were told that they were out of salmon, lamb, and spinach asbwell as one of they baeses to a desert. Then we noticed a confrontation between a member of the waitstaff and a disgruntled customer. I am not sure what had happened but it was enough to rattle the customers nearby and my wife, who was opposite me on the other side of the bar area. Next, I had ordered a gin and tonic and it was all tonic with about 4 ice cubes in a glass a bit bigger than a highball glass . The last straw was when we got the desert. I had ordered their desert shooters wanting something sweet. I had the banana coffee which was really good, the tiramisu and the cheesecake. I had finished the banana one, went half way through the tiamisu and decided to try the cheesecake. The cheesecake had not had a chance to set and was runny which was really dissappointing. I went back to the tiramisu and the NEXT BITE HIT A PIECE OF PLASTIC! I told our waiter and he brought the manager over and he apologized and offered us something else. I didnt want to take my chances so I asked for the check. He said he would comp our deserts and when the check came he only took mime off.... I just paid and left. They waiter we had said that they were closing in a few days for a remodel but I feel like they dont care about their quality and customers why would you go back?",

Decent but dreary Italian food \"jus like-a mamma use-da make eh\", assuming your mamma is a 20 stone welder from Pilton, you know exactly what to expect from here.  What you won't expect though, is penne with duck, spring onions and plum sauce. I'm assured it's fantastic, but I've never been brave enough to try the most bizarre food combination I've seen since Asda did Ninja Turtles branded chocloate and marshmallow pizza.",

One thing you can say about Bella is that it is usually busy and the staff are more than accommodating. We visited on a bank holiday and the place was packed, but the waitress went out of her way to move a table for two for us and seat us in less than ten minutes which was really nice.  This restaurant is a chain, so don't expect anything out of the ordinary or anything too authentic. It kind of reminds me of Frankie and Bennys or DiMaggio's which kind of leave me a bit deflated, although I will say that Bella Italia is one of the better chains I have visited.  I had spaghetti Gamberi (which to me and you is spaghetti with prawns, tomato, chili and garlic) I usually get this in every Italian I go to so I'm quite a good judge of it, and I have to say this was one of the nicer ones I have had! My friend went for lasagne which looked very nice, and I tried a wee sneaky bit. It was lovely too!  The bill for two with wine came to just under 30 which was pretty good going. I was impressed and would certainly go there again.",

The pizza hut on Cockburn Street and Pizza Paradise on North Bridge were both closed on the Sunday after Christmas, so our options were limited. It worked to our advantage. Located at the intersection with High Street about halfway between Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood Palace, it is an excellent stopping point if you are making a day of walking the 'Royal Mile'   Our family of 5 was taken in immediately and given a seating area where there was space for our pram as well as a high chair. The children were given place mats to color on and do activities.   Two of the girls shared the pizza meal off the children's menu. This came with vanilla ice cream and when they served it each child received a full portion. They were elated and took all the time they needed to finish it off.   My wife and I shared a Bruschetta and then a vegetarian pizza with all the fixings. The glass of Pinot Griggio washed it all down very nicely. Our window seats gave us the opportunity to people watch in between tending to the children.   I really enjoyed the way the server did not rush us. He gave us the time we needed to get through each stage of our meal. With three young children we tend to move at a different pace. The one down side is the location of the toilet rooms-located 1 1/2 stories down. It makes it a bit difficult with small children, especially babies.",

When he said that it's gonna take around 25 - 30 mins, we inquired politely if there was anyway to expedite. We were about to ask if there are items on the menu that might take less preparation time, when he cut us off with the most absurdly arrogant statement I ever heard from a server \"This is a restaurant and not a fast food joint. It is going to take that time (Not to mention the attitude he was sporting on his face while uttering this)\". It took my wife and I(Unanimously) all about 2 secs to get up and leave the place after hearing that. I am still unable to believe the kind of arrogance this man showed and the negligence that this business carries towards their patrons. If I am ever back in Edinburgh, I will make sure to NOT visit this place again - EVER!  Folks at Bella Italia - Remember, you are not running a charity here. People pay for your service and the survival of your business lies entirely at the mercy of your patrons. Enough with the attitude already.",

Kids got fresh homemade soda...quite good. We got beer and cocktails which were nice.  Kids had pasta and ribs, both of which they finished so much have been good.  I had the Carbonara pasta, which I have to say I am a very highly critical off...it was okay, which is not bad....again highly critical...my point of comparison is a mom and pop Resturant in Italia where a grandmother made it for me....not fair but this is life.  Wife had a sausage Stromboli....she was quite impressed and finished it all to my surprise. Overall night recommend, service was pretty good, noting the place was packed with folks waiting for a table at 10:30pm. If you in area and want a good spot...this is am option for sure!",

The services was great (basically the majority of the rating was because of the service). The man who served us was very kind and generous and couldn't have done a better job.  Food :- A friend had ordered for me as I was getting ready in the hotel room so by the time I arrived it was slightly cold, the waiter offered to heat it up for me, which he did. Upon tasting the food the mushrooms were slightly burnt - the chicken was fine and nothing special. The potatoes tasted as if someone had thrown a heap of salt on them which wasn't that good.  Quite hard to judge this restaurant as I was pretty jet lagged and very hungry!! So I will probably give it another chance before I leave.",

The only redeeming quality was that the waiter was polite, but that's expected. Try something local or go to another Italian restaurant in town, or for half the price, buy a frozen lasagna at Tesco, heat it up in your microwave and it will taste just the same!",

It was 10:30pm and we were starving and this seemed to be the closest place on the Royal Mile that was still open! It fit all of our criteria so in we went for it. We had not realized that this was a chain, so the food is that more impressive. I can't say that I've dined at many chains and had really delicious food. The menu was pretty extensive, from numerous pasta bowls to the selection of pizza, there was something for everyone and the prices were pretty reasonable, so that was another selling point.  Our waiter was really nice, and made great recommendations, albeit the service was a tad slow. We started off with the Mozzarella Pomodoro which came out crispy and fluffy. I had the Agnello Tagliatelle, which was a heaping bowl of pasta and they didn't go light on the lamb either, the flavors were great, a very rich dish. I was starving and by the end of the meal, it didn't even look like I made a dent in the plate at all!  My husband had the Carne Mista pizza and raved about it being one of the better pizzas he's had in a while. The restaurant was very intimate at that time of night and the people watching was fantastic, it really added some interesting entertainment for the night. There was a taxi stand across the street so it was very easy to get back to our hotel afterwards.  We were pleasantly surprised with our random pick, we were weary that it would be a tourist trap, it probably was, but we really had a great time, it was well past midnight when we left and never once felt rushed despite the hour of the night.",

    "text": "Oh no, no, no.  THAT is not how Italian food is done. How would I know? Oh, I don't know, perhaps my many years of holidaying in Italy itself for months on end, perhaps my many, many Italian friends who have taught me over the years how to make a proper pasta, perhaps the fact that I have functioning taste-buds. Something which the kitchen-staff here seems to be lacking.  The service: we ordered, and the waiter was rude to the point of snatching, not taking the menus away from us. When out choices arrived and he tried to get the attention of one of our friends to alert her that her dish had arrived, he yelled, -no really he YELLED- \"OI CALZONE!\" at her. Conversation stopped dead, we all stared. The tables next to us stared. Rudest waiter experience I've ever had, in my life. And I've been to Paris multiple times so that's saying quite a lot. For the duration of the night he was extremely embarrassed, but suffice to say that we didn't leave a tip.  The food: ugh. Ugh, ugh, ugh. When you look at the food and think: \"Should've gone to Domino's..\" you know it's bad. I had the Calimari, ... I think? It tasted like deep-fried breadcrumbs with croutons inside of them instead of calimari. Next to it was a greasy, uninspired, over-salted sauce which should've come with fish 'n chips instead of a dainty starter.   And the thing that pisses me off the most is that I paid 5.85 for the privilege of getting my taste buds assaulted, yelled at by a waiter, and ogled by the rest of the (male) staff in a manner which was so insulting, I'll not repeat it here.  Oh, and did I mention that our jug of water contained half a chopped at lemon (you know the one you find behind at the back of your fridge, all dried up, that one) AND a piece of wax. Yes, there was a large piece of candle-wax in my glass of water.  Jum.  Steer clear, do NOT come here!",

Although the food was good, you can definitely find better in the locality for far cheaper.  The menu has a good range of authentic Italian dishes and I went for the penne with chicken in a roasted pepper and wine sauce.   Our food took a while to arrive, but when it did it was served in decent portions and tasted pretty good. Bella Itali has some nice food on offer, but you'll probably go away expecting more for your money.",

He berated my table and others with a pseudo Italian accent and even sexually harassed one of our tables females calling her his \"ex girlfriend\" to his other wait staff at an attempt at a joke. Our order which was forgotten about until we complained 1 and a half hours later! was awful to says the least. When we complained about the time it was taking to get our orders after 3 surrounding tables of similar meals were all served what did \"Dan the Man\" do? He argued and berated me and my table for 10min! Until the manager had to get involved. Saying it takes a long time to cook food and that it was our fault for ordering appetizers? Then when we did get our food one order was wrong and how long did it take to cook their made to order pizza? 7min this time! So what happened last time Dan? Why did it take so long? I can't understand how in this day in age someone like him is employed and allowed to harass and argue with customers like that.   The food If it was simply a bad waiter I would have conceded and gave this place more stars, however the food was equally as bad on all orders! The pizza's of which we ordered three were all burnt, thin, stiff, and lacking any cheeses or sauce. This is some of the toughest, most cardboard like pizza I have ever tasted in my life. I don't think it is made to order and I dont think they have competent kitchen staff either frankly. The speciality pizza's were lacking ingredients and using sub par quality ingredients. Everyone at my table noted how downright absurd the quality was here. I can't understand how this place has a licence to operate.   Overall  Avoid this place at all costs. It has a nice interior and location, thats about all it has going for it. The wait time is long, other reviews mention similar issues, it has from what I can tel now a track history with downright appalling customer service and food quality. They leech on tourists that are unsuspecting looking for the first place that looks nice to eat at and scam them of money with awful food and an unstable staff. Please mind this warning and don't risk it, there are a plethora of other more highly rated places to eat than this abomination.",

We had a reasonably priced bottle of chianti and calamari appetizers.  Both were excellent.  Again, the restaraunt was packed and we felt that they produced our meal effortlessly.  The pasta prices were very reasonable and the food was prepared with imagination and color. This is a good choice for Italian in a non-pretenscious establishment.",

It was around the corner from our hotel and easy to find seating during busy evenings when we didn't make reservations.  Their pizza was so good.  It had the right amount of sauce and cheese with the perfect amount of crunch to the crust.  I have to say I was very glad I found this place our second day of visiting. We were greeted and seated pretty quickly and our waiter was actually our waiter each time we visited, but I think that was just a fluke.  LOL.  He was spot on.  We didn't have to ask for anything for the most part.  He was there and refilling glasses, taking orders, and bringing napkins. If you are near the Royal Mile, stop in.  I am sure you will not regret it.",

It is not for a formal occasion.  We arrived pretty ravenous after a swim and wanted somewhere to sit and something to fill our bellies with.   On arrival we were greeted and invited to anywhere we'd fancied.  The table was bare save napkins and cutlery. Our waitress provided the menus.  We took wine and I had a pasta with prawns and chilli. Lovely.   Now for the best part: they have just recently introduced \"mini desserts\" - Yes sir.  You can order 3 or 5 desserts and they come in shot glasses - pannacotta, banana toffee (Banoffee), tiramisu, cheesecake and a deep chocolate ganache like thingy.  Brilliant for sharing and this was simply wonderful in execution and taste.   if you want authentic Italian, go to an authentic Italian.  When you want good simple tasty pasta dishes and nice dessert selection? Go to Bella Italia.",
