    "text": "A decent chip shop, open late most nights and the staff are very efficient (I've never seen chips wrapped so quickly in my life).   I actually feel it's 3.5 stars here, 75% of the time I have been here I've been happy with what I've got, but a couple of times I went in there was a bit of a funny after taste to the chips (which was very slight, not too noticeable) which I suspect was because the oil was needing to be changed in the fryer and the chips had taken on too much of an \"old\" flavour. In defence of the shop though, friends I were with disagreed with me. Anyway, I felt this after taste two visits in a row and kind of put me off, but on  subsequent visits everything was really nice.  I've had pizza here a couple of times and wasn't blown away by it, better than generic chain places but not as good as many other Italian run places. I'm sticking to the chips.",

I would say give this one a go, it had everything in batter. First trip there I had a battered haggis and chips, and the second trip was a battered cheese burger and chips. Thank god I was there only for the weekend :)",
