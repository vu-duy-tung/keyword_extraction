    "text": "Understated service, friendly but not cloying. Adequate wine list. Small choice of gins, more whiskeys. Chic look and chic crowd. Nice departure from Scottish pubs and whiskey joints. Bread comes with pesto/lovage/mint butter. Delightful Gaspacho arrives as an empty bowl except for a spoonful of ricotta, a cherry tomato, and a sliver of fennel. The waiter adds a thin broth on it, then you have to stir the ricotta in. The duck breast, though the waitress didn't ask is a perfect medium rare, unsliced, but accompanied with an adequate steak knife. Spring roll, filled with cabbage and nuts is a fine addition as are the blackberries and carrot puree. Paired with the Mourvedre/Syrah from S. Africa was a great idea. The sea bass is amazingly good - every bite. The tiny potato beignets are a nice touch.  Scallops with chorizo arrived without chorizo. Waitress says they are wee bits.  We couldn't finish the sea bass and sadly left no room for dessert.",

It's so bad that the restaurant has a humid, gym locker room smell to it right when you step in the door. The wait staff refused to open the back door to the restaurant to get some airflow even though all patrons were complaining. This restaurant has received a lot of hype so I had high expectations for the food but found it to taste just average. I have a dairy allergy and was very frustrated when I was trying to order because our waiter did not take my allergy seriously.",

    "text": "Really wonderful, imaginative food, friendly staff, quiet, intimate atmosphere.  My husband and I were  really impressed with the food here. We come from Berkeley, California which is foodie heaven, and both of us are fairly good cooks.  The scallop starter surprised us by pairing blackberries with scallops, which I would never have imagined as compatible flavors. It was delicious, and my one minor tweet would be pulling back on the sweetness of the berries and adding some acidic element, like lemon or a vinaigrette. My husband loved the lamb and I had the sea bass. Both dishes were flavorful and perfectly cooked. I ordered the avocado ice cream and lemon cheesecake with crumble.  The ice cream was incredibly creamy, but lacked some sweetness (for my tastes) and the lemon dessert was really mouth-watering, except that it seemed to be semi-frozen and impossible to cut until it had thawed. My husband liked the rice pudding but could have skipped the granola crumble, but that's just personal taste. Overall it was a great meal, very special, and I would not hesitate to go back again.",
