    "text": "Having passed this place everyday for a week while taking the bus, we finally figured it was worth a try, especially since everything else had closed by 10PM. All I can say is: WOW. The food here is STELLAR. As good as the Chinese food I grew up with in NY, and far better than anything we find in LA, and crazy affordable. Usually you're down to compromise for convenience over quality at a late night spot but this would be good at any hour of the day. My boyfriend just said \"I've never had Chinese food that good,\" and he isn't exaggerating.  We got the hot and sour soup, prawn chow mein and chicken fried rice. The soup was complex, spicy and flavorful, chock full of proteins (chicken and tiny shrimp) and bamboo shoots and mushrooms as a hot and sour soup ought to be. Hands down one of the best I've ever had. (My dad always told me: if a place does hot and sour right, you know it's going to be good... and he was definitely right for here!) The mains were equally impressive: the rice was just so delicious, in spite of its simplicity: loved the great onion flavor, and I just can't get over the chow mein: the prawns were HUGE and juicy. There's no way we won't be eating here on a regular basis, especially given that all that food only cost about 15 pounds. We were stuffed by the end, and still had some leftover rice for later. Don't know why this place wouldn't have all the stars: saw some comment about customer service, but we had no issues: just great food! Plus it's take away so... don't know what there is to complain about! High, high, highly recommended.",

    "text": "There's no getting round the fact that from the outside it doesn't look great. However, the food is amazing. I've been a local customer for years now and wouldn't go elsewhere. Menu is varied with good choice. I've only tried the vegetarian dishes, but family assure me meat dishes are really good too. It's the only cantonese restaurant I've been to in UK where the greens are actually green. The salt and chilli tofu is the best I've ever tasted, especially with the sweet honey and chilli sauce.Chow mein is perfect with slightly smoky flavour. Rice and spring rolls are average. There is often a wait for delivery, esp at weekends, so we often will go pick it up, but worth bearing in mind when ordering.",

    "text": "This is a great Canotonese takeaway in Morningside which serves amazing, good quality food at good prices.  I've not been in myself, but my flatmates and I have ordered twice from here and both times it's been excellent.  I had an authentic beef curry with rice the first time which was delicious with a rich, spicy sauce.  The second time I had the salt and pepper chicken which also tasted amazing.  Both meals came with a free bag of crunchy prawn crackers and only cost about 8 each in total.   My only complaint would be that delivery seemed to take ages, despite the guy on the phone's assurances that it would only be half an hour.  Nonetheless, Food For You serves great food at excellent prices.",
