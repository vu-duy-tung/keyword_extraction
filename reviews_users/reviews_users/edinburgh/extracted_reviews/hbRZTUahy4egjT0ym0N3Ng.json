Whilst the food might not be Michelin star standard, it is fast and satisfying.  The decor is fairly standard, and I'm not sure whether they actually do their own brewing on the premise.  Anyway, this place is great for a pre- or post-cinema beverage, or a quick burger.  I can highly recomment the 5 burger and a pint deal.  Bargain!",

Decent lunch menu & offers home made burger salad & chips & a pint for 5, and validates your 3 parking for 4 hours to let you go shopping or see Edinburgh Castle, Chambers Street Museum, 5mins from Union Canal, if you are happy walking around on a day trip. Decor is nice with interesting windowed view of beer making brewery and tables outside for nice evenings & smokers.",

McCowans won't break the bank, and the food is excellent quality for what you pay. Perfect start to a night out, either messy or cinema.  They've got projector screens and multiple televisions for viewing the sports for major events, but doesn't get too rowdy when the sports are on either.  If you want to reserve space, there's an entire upstairs mezzanine that can be booked out with separate toilets and bar.",

    "text": "Popped in after a movie at the Cineworld next door. McCowan's is a typical chain pub, lacking in character, but with (generally) good prices. Menu has all the typical food items like burgers, roasts, sausage and mash etc. Kitchen was closed when we came so we only had drinks. Will try to return in the future to try the food.  Looking through the drinks menu, most prices were very good- 3-4 for a glass of wine, 3.50 for a cocktail, and a large selection of beers (however, these have no prices advertised). We decided on draught Becks which was on the menu. However, on reaching the bar, I was informed there was no Becks, and was recommended Moretti instead. Sounds good, I said. These cost 4.40 each, quite steep in my opinion, especially compared to the other prices of wine, food, cocktails, desserts etc.  The staff members I encountered were perfectly friendly, and service was quick. The table was quite sticky and not clean, but it was quite late in the evening, so I imagine plenty of people had already sat there.  Overall, a handy and decent place to check out when at Cineworld. Food menu looks good, so will have to return in the future.",

    "text": "I can only imagine the sheer number of Yelpers gasping at the four stars above. To them I say desist your food snobbery and listen up.  With the likes of the over-rated Fountain and the, for me, yet-to-experience-but-often-lauded Caley Sample Rooms in the near vicinity, you'd be forgiven for never trying McCowans. After all it is just some chain-menu, run of the mill, football showing, gastro average Joe.  But I would challenge that and say McCowans was an HONEST Joe.  In fairness McCowans doesn't try to be something it's not. It doesn't even claim to be something it's not. The food is nothing special, but it's nothing to be sniffed at either. This is the kind of place you can come along to, grab a seat on the deep leather couch in the corner and order a chicken burger, sausage and mash or a curry of the day for only 4.   And you know what you'll get? A half-decent gastro meal worth 4. No more, no less. That doesn't sound like much, but I'll bet after you step out of McCowans you'll feel like 4 commands a little more quality than you thought it did.  When you consider the number of wannabe quality gastro pubs, for example the infinitely underwhelming 1780 on Rose Street, who charge 6 for a starter and 11 a main, that leave you feeling robbed, questioning where the flavour was, where the ingredients were foraged, what jail their chef just got released from. Okay that last one's a bit harsh - the point is there are plenty of over-priced pubs with fancy menus and zero quality out there. And every one of them will have you appreciating exactly what McCowans is.  On top of that they brew their own beers, they have enough telly boxes to play more than one football match at a time, they have oodles of space to lounge, they're right beside a cinema, casino and bowling alley. And they have some of the friendliest, most consistently decent bar staff I've encountered. Honestly I defy you to get served by one of the bearded lads at the bar and NOT be engaged in conversation. Doing their job well.  If you're still in doubt, try the Joey Sunday Challenge:  When you've had a large weekend, you're feeling a bit tender and looking for something to make you feel a little better. Get on Cineworld online, get yourself tickets to a nice wee movie, and get yourself to McCowans an hour early for a pre-movie bite.  On Sundays McCowans not only offer full Sunday Roasts, but even more enticing are the Yorkshire Pudding Rolls. Choose from either Chicken, Gammon or Beef, and they place the meat in a giant Yorkshire, roll that badboy up like a wrap, chop it in half and serve it up with some roasties and a wee jug of gravy. Boom - enjoy your movie! Doctor couldn't prescribe anything better for a sensitive Sunday afternoon.  If that doesn't win you over try the desserts.... just wow!  And if even that fails, don't worry about it. At least you gave it a try.... **cough**snob**cough**!!",

I have not eaten here, but the food supplied looks simple and fresh.   I find the staff is very friendly, but could be a little more efficient.   There is no \"wow factor\" or unique character to this bar, but I don't think a place as this is actually going for that.   Good place to start for a evening out to the cinema, dinner etc..",

    "text": "the food selection around the Cineworld complex in fountainbridge has two general themes: cheap and cheerful chain restaurants or slightly overpriced independent restaurants where the quality of food can vary.  so when needing a quick bit before seeing a movie, i'm quite happy to head to one of the chain restaurants and save myself a bit of money and know that i'll get decent food at a good price.    McCowans Brewhouse is a chain but their menu has a number of good options including a 2 main meals for 10 deal if you fancy any of the selected items on this menu.  as i had eaten a few hours previously, i was happy just to have a snack and ordered the cheesy nachos for everyone to share.  they were 4 for a decent sized portion of nachos with melted cheese, jalapenos, salsa, and sour cream and guacamole on the side.  my only compliant was that there just wasn't enough cheese for the amount of tortitlla chips and because of this about half the portion was left over.  so this place is definitely A-OK for pre or post movie food and definitely much better value than the independent restaurants that are nearby.",

It has a similar feel to a Wetherspoons pub, although as far as I am aware it isn't one. Big comfy chairs, cheapish drinks and cheap food. I haven't eaten here so can't comment on how the food tastes, but the menu is your typical pub food. Having seen food pass me by for other tables it does actually look quite good and good sized portions. It gets quite busy in here with people going for something to eat after work or before the cinema so I guess it must be quite good.  According to my friend who drinks ales they do a good selection, but I don't even know what an ale is so I can't comment. Overall its a good reliable, spacious bar for a cheap drink and some cheap grub before heading off to the overpriced cinema.",

In this respect it is ideal; decent food, reasonable beer/ales and quick enough service.  What it isn't is a pub I would want to spend an entire evening in. It feels a little soulless, perhaps due to a limitation of location, fountain park in many ways defining the feel...  Don't discount it, it is a good starting location (preferable to Nandos or Pizza Hut) but will likely never be more than that. It is a decent chain pub, serving a purpose and doing it well enough accept it at face value and enjoy your food and a quick drink.",
