    "text": "I gave it a try on a Tuesday at 1 pm, as I was curious about this Italian owned place. I was \"welcomed\" by the cave man owner who did not speak to me, not even to say hello, good afternoon, goodbye, etc. He generically pointed at some tables, so I sat down. Fortunately, both waitresses were polite and friendly. Ordered a Pizza Capricciosa plus a sparkling mineral water which I received in a timely fashion.  The pizza was OK; on the plus side, it was tasty enough as its ingredients were from the upper part of the quality scale and weren't oily which can ruin the whole culinary experience. However, its base (dough) was rather bland as I couldn't enjoy the proper yeast after taste and it had the tough consistency of a Ritz cracker...what a shame... The place interiors are in need of a super urgent revamp as the place looks like a 1970's run down place...  Price-wise it was a bit dear for the kind of place ( 13.95 for the pizza)... Oh well, plenty issues to be addressed ... not sure if I will give it another go in the near future...",

However, the decor is aging, food is hit or miss with an emphasis on the latter (their greatest sin is blandness), and the chefs/waitstaff are certainly a strange bunch. Kinda feels like another planet sometimes. Still a great place to go for cheap food and coffee. Did I mention how god damn amazing the coffee is? And it comes with a Biscoff cookie.",

    "text": "It's New Year's eve and we needed some fuel before we head to one John's epic house parties.  After a bit of searching on Yelp, I found Cafe Artista. Just around the corner form John's in Marchmont. A small restaurant promising authentic Italian cuisine, perfect! What better to soak up a stupid amount of alcohol with then a great big calzone. I booked a table for 4 over the phone.   We arrived a tad early but that was perfectly fine with them. The restaurant is BYOB with no corkage so we made sure to have a couple of bottles of plonk with us.   The decor is nothing special but it has a welcoming feel to it. The kitchen takes up half of the restaurant so you can see them working away. Our lovely waitress shows us to our table. The menu is simple with classic starters and pizza and pasta to follow. They have a few meat dishes so I go for the pan fried chicken in tomato sauce. My fellow diners opting for pizza and calzones. They don't offer gluten free pizza but they do for pasta.   Our food arrives quicker than expected, which is great as we are starving. The pizzas are fabulous, thin and crispy on a wood fired base. My chicken dish is fresh tasting and very delicious. Be warned the portions are huge! We may need a disco nap before heading to John's party.   Saying that, we do go for dessert. David cannot resist a piece of chocolate fudge cake, I go for good old vanilla icecream. Both very nice.   This place is only very affordable - bonus! The bill coming to about 50 for the four of us.   Cafe Artista is a great no-fuss, no- nonsense family run restaurant. The food is big and tasty! Don't expect a fine dining establishment but do expect to be well fed!  Cheers, Amy",

I have been coming here for years for a long slow Sunday breakfast with news papers and lots of coffee. The breakfast used to be really good, but this was swapped for a breakfast bagel instead which isn't very good as a comparison and costs 8quid!!! Switched to the pizza or omlettes for my Sunday outing and they are both great.   I stopped coming a few years back after having a few to many strange experiences with the owner. Not aimed at me but others in the restaurant, either that or the piano starts getting played badly for a few minute bursts every 10 minutes. The cafe can be far from relaxing sometimes the last few times I went anyway.   I went back after a period away and everything is the same. Good pizza and strange behaviors towards the customers. The decor has been spruced up recently which is nice, but I am not comfortable sitting here for extended periods of time.",

As bizarre as the scenario may seem, he is not in a sitcom, he is definitely not a stand up comedian, he is just being rude.  He continuously ignores the existance of customers, sweeps beneath their feet, growls when bags are poking out from under tables, and stops conversations mid sentence without any explanation to take a smoke/start betting on horse races. When you are finished eating, don't expect to hang around. He will want to clear your table and get you out of here as soon as possible.   The pizza here is decent, and the coffee is not bad, but considering that there are plenty of other really fantastic places where staff treat customers with more respect, I wouldn't recommend this place. It's a shame, considering that the chef, on the other hand,  is really lovely.",

As we were leaving, the previously nice man shouted after us, saying we were unwelcome any way, especially if we couldn't afford the menu.. and I believe he said he only wanted customers that could pay anyway!

What's so difficult about just sticking an egg on whilst you're cooking the sausages?!!  In the end I just had a sausage roll which was pretty nice and my mate had a panini which he enjoyed.   The place is clean and the decor is nice enough, but the service isn't really up to scratch.  It was quite busy when we were in, although this doesn't justify waiting almost half an hour for a roll and a panini.

When we eventually sat down, all my friends ordered bacon rolls while I went for the Minestroni Soup. Bad choice. It was tasteless, watery and somehow rubbery, whilst my friends said their bacon rolls were amazing. But you can't really get them wrong, right?! When we came to pay there was a bit of trouble with splitting the bill, but we managed to sort it out amongst ourselves as the waitress was being really awkward with it.

Still, he made me stand in the corner until I had my food. Hmm. And now I know this seems to be a regular thing, its happened to me more than once and various other stories reveal no more compasion to others.

    "text": "I fantasize about real authentic  Italian Coffee more than I have ever fantasized about some handsome bit of stuff  in Armani underpants.  So having recently moved to Edinburgh I was delighted when my flatmates informed me of a scrumptious Italian Eatery serving  cups of the real Italian good stuff called Cafe Artista.   What they failed to mention, however was the terrorizing test of faith, necessary to obtain the eventually delicious liquid.   The proprietor, as authentically continental as his java, is how I imagine Bernard Black, of Black Books would be, had he actually existed and lived in Italy. That is to say the obvious contempt he shows his clientele, would put all but the most intrepid coffee lover off returning . On my  first visit, having chased away a customer who had dared ask for a takeaway latte at a very busy time, he reprimanded me for looking at the food on display and not into his eyes before deciding on my purchase.   I am naturally quite a timid person and I fear I would have been put off, had the end prospect been the aforementioned hunk and not the object of my affections; Italian coffee. Thankfully my courage was rewarded and I was presented with the best tasting cup of coffee I have had since living in Scotland.   The food;  an italian twist on the usual cafe fair,  is reasonably priced and to a high standard. I particularly enjoy the bruschetta with mozzarella and roasted root vegetables. Delicious!  Having now lived sometime in Marchmont, it seems that the pit bull running the joint  is something of a novelty to native marchmonters;  his lunchtime fits, a form of local entertainment.   So, for those of you like me, who love your coffee and being entertained whilst you drink it, I would highly recommend Cafe Artista. For those of you who believe drinking coffee should be a more peaceful endeavour, it is well worth braving asking for a takeout, if you manage to pertain it, your efforts will have been compensated.",

There's always a bit of yelling or angry whispering, someone consoles someone else who seems on the verge of tears and then eventually all is calm and your tricolore salad arrives with a flourish.

I had never experienced anything like it before I moved to Marchmont and there is something about the place that keeps me going back time after time.   Run by the Bova family, it caters for breakfast, lunchtime and dinner customers. The menu is very simple, offering the usual favourites including baked potatos, pizzas, paninis, sandwiches, and a great selection of cakes, all served in a no-fuss manner.   I've never had a problem with the efficiency of the staff here, although they do get stressed sometimes. On many occasions I have found myself in the middle of an unfolding Italian family drama going on around me! However, far from detracting from the atmosphere, in my opinion this adds some comedy value and gives the place a bit of personality!   I would highly recommend Cafe Artista - it doesnt try to be something it is not and if you're looking for a good, no-fuss family-run cafe, this is well worth a visit.",

He hates students and old people (I was fortunate enough to hear his views on the elderly once); actually, it's become clear to me after reading other reviews that Bruno just hates everybody - which is fine with me, but not if you're going to run a cafe and project your hatred onto your paying customers.   As far as the food goes, it's extremely average, and way overpriced for what it is.   It's a burning shame that Fuel Deli is now closed (they used to be opposite Cafe Artista). If you're looking for a good deli, friendly staff, and a distinct absence of hostility, walk down Melville Terrace and go to Victor Hugo. Trust me, it's worth it - avoid Cafe Artista at all costs.",

    "text": "Cafe Artista is one of my favourite places to go for a 12 o'clock coffee and bacon roll, and as you may have guessed from other reviews not just the food. I'm never in there for that long really but invariably some minor drama will unfold. I've never seen anyone one go totally schiz at someone leaning there bike against the side of the building then rush outside and greet them with a smile and handshake. Failing this you can usually rely on a family argument! There pizzas and meze etc are also very yummy.   To those of you doubting out there, then consider this, for the price nowhere else do you get such good food and free theatre..... And I have a funny feeling that if you take your children in there and act like a self important arse then you deserve to be taken down a peg or two.   Great fun place.",
