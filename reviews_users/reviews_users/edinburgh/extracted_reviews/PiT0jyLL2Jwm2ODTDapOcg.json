    "text": "Nearly every student has heard of the Mosque Kitchen. There is a reason for that.  Situated near George Sq in the centre of town, the Mosque Kitchen is a canteen-esque restaraunt attached to the Edinburgh Mosque. This where students come to fill up with big portions of cheap curry!  Don't be put off though, cheap does not mean poor quality. The Mosque Kitchen serves a small range of curry every day. There is usually a small selection, that can be accompanied with rice with some side servings such as nan. Food is dished up into polystyrene dishes and eaten with plastic cutlery. But make no mistake; the curry is great quality and the portions very reasonable. Regular attendees appreciate the lack of fuss made over the presentation; they are here for what the kitchen sets out to do, provide great curry for all!  The Mosque Kitchen has a communal feel and expects to have some great chat, especially if you come regularly, sitting at one of the few long, school-cafeteria type tables.  If you're visiting Edinburgh and you want to see where the locals, especially the students, eat out, or you are looking for somewhere less pricey to fill up for the day, try the Mosque Kitchen. If you live in Edinburgh and you haven't been, why not?",

If it's luxury, ambience, or even proper cutlery you're after, you won't find it here. If however it's a tasty curry at frankly unbelievably cheap prices you want, then that's exactly what you'll get.  I'm so carnivorous I'd happily feast on a roadkill rabbit by the side of the motorway, so I was pretty surprised to find it was the vegetable curry, with all sorts of greenery thrown in, that was my favourite. I expect I'll be a regular visitor here though, so that may change.  It's places like this that really give a city it's character, and I'd much rather give my hard earned to the people of the mosque than many of the city's more unscrupulous curry house owners. I urge you to do the same.",

I love the canteen feel, the outdoor picnic table seating, the paper plates and the plastic spoons. It doesn't have to please aesthetically just to pull in the punters the people of Edinburgh know a good curry when they eat it and this is why the Mosque Kitchen is so popular.  Absolutely great with a big bunch of friends on a summers evening, brilliant if you're skint or if you just can't be bothered cooking as the generous portions will fill you up no problems. It's also the kind of place you could just go and sit on your own tucking into some curry and doing a spot of people watching.   Little independent places like this are great and I highly recommend visiting, the vegetable curry is my favourite, it's nice and spicy - just the way I like it. Brilliant!",

Take it to go and eat in the meadows or somewhere else sans-pigeon.  This makes for a great date - excellent food + hole-in-the-wall panache = second date.

If the food wasn't as good then you probably wouldn't come back, you certainly don't come for the surroundings.

I have been here a good few times, and I must say that the last time I went, I was a bit disappointed by the naan bread, and thought it was a bit dry, but it is the festival period and I came late in the day, so perhaps this may have had something to do with it. Even if this was a common occurrence, I would probably still give this place 5 stars, as the curry tastes divine and the portions will fill you up no matter how hungry you are. If you do not want to fork out on extra money on drinks there is a water fountain just outside the kitchen area and there are cups where you can have this water instead. A couple of very minor criticisms of the place is that there are lots of pigeons who pester you during your meal while you sit under the gazebo and they only supply a spoon rather than a knife and fork. Other than this, it's great, there aren't many places in Edinburgh that can be this!",

Anyway, I was after the \"meat\" but they sold out so I went for the chicken. I'm not sure what part of the chicken they used but it seemed very fatty. Pretty tasty though. And for the asking price, still pretty good.  Had another funny conversation with the guy behind the counter after the \"meat?\" \"no meat, chicken!\" conversation. I asked if he had any garlic naan.

Be warned that this is more of a cafeteria than a restaurant. They will serve you the food inside, and then you go outside to the plastic tables and fold out chairs to enjoy your warm meal.

The food is cheap, filling and incredibly tasty. The menu is quite limited, but what it lacks in variety it more than makes up in the yum stakes. There's enough on offer for meat eaters and veggies alike to be satisfied.   You can get a large plate of lentil dhal and rice for 3 and a freshly made nan bread for 1. Other things on offer include a spinach dish, vegetable curry, lamb curry and chicken curry, as well as garlic nans, samosas and a few other bits and pieces. Portion sizes are large and very enjoyable - a bit of a rarity in Edinburgh these days!   Don't expect airs and graces. The place is canteen style and you'll be eating your grub off paper plates with plastic cutlery. The decor is clean and contemporary, with long tables happily accommodating ten people or more. The food is served buffet style and the service is quick but a little abrupt.   I was told that the Mosque Kitchen's profits go towards funding the mosque and that the staff are volunteers, so I'm not surprised that the service can sometimes be a little lacking in finesse (that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars).   If you want something sweet to round off your meal, cakes and pastries are available starting at around 1.   Brilliant value for money, fab food and a nice atmosphere make for a great bit of budget dining in the city.",

The menu is basic but has classic chicken, lamb and vegetarian options so likely to be somehting to suit everyone and with prices starting at 3.00 for tarka dahl with rice to 4.50 for chicken curry and rice you definately wont be breaking the bank! The sag aloo was delicious and the garlic nan is worth the wait!  If you've not been here before then I'll try and set the scene. Dont think of it as a restaurant (there's no menu cards or table service) maybe more of a canteen, there's a menu on the wall and a self service area where you are served food that's ready and waiting. Bear in mind that the restaurant belongs to the Mosque and so there's no extravagance. It's plastic plates and cutlery however it somehow makes it feel more authentic! As you would expect there's no alcohol available but there is a good range of soft drinks including traditional lassies.   All in all if you like a good curry at fantastic prices then I'd recommend you come here!",

My friend and I got the buffet. This was mainly do not knowing what specifically to order and wanting to sample too much. Anyway, the food is great. There is so much to choose from. I especially liked the pakora, rice, naan, and sheekh kebabs. Those kebabs were bloody spicy.  If you're doing the buffet, you'll pay and get your plate at the main counter. If you're purchasing items off their menu, you can pay where the food is being served. They only accept cash.",

I have to say it was one of the two things I missed while I was away (Kopperberg was the other!) and I was worried it might have changed....  Maybe the prices had gone up...... maybe they don't do lamb anymore.... maybe the pigeons had killed everyone in a fit of impulsive hunger and taken over the little yard behind the Mosque, making it a death trap for the students and locals of Newington.....!!  Thankfully none of the above had in fact happened, although, inevitably, there was one niggling negative upon my return......  And that was the great big 'Mosque Kitchen' sign over the archway.  This kitchen is Edinburgh's best kept secret and should really stay that way if we want to enjoy the portions, the price and the level of service from the lovely folk that run the place. Same thing happened to KFC and that place is EXTORTIONATE now!!  .......okay I can't back that up.  Other than that, I got the ground minced lamb rather than the big chunky lamb.... bit of a surprise but still great. Chicken's still the chicken.  Winner!",

Stand in line, pick what you want , pay and go back to your seat. Has surprisingly good curry. I really enjoyed the spinach lamb curry. I recommend it! They also have a variety of ethnic beverages to have with your meal. What sold me was the amount of food for the price . It's cheap and left me stuffed! The place also seemed clean when I was there and the staff also friendly. If your tight on money and have a hankering for curry and want a lot of food for cheap this is the place.",

Serving locals, students and even the business elite, the luring smell of home cooked, honest Indian fare attracts all. Offering a limited but exceptionally affordable array of dishes, the Mosque Kitchen produces some simple but flavoursome gems. Vegetarians can enjoy a truly moreish Tarka Dahl or a flavoursome spinach and potato curry, whilst those of a more meaty persuasion can indulge in one of the Mosque's daily chicken or lamb servings. With the offering of rice, plain or garlic naan to accompany each dish, diners can anticipate a meal that satisfies any level of hunger.   A word of warning, though, diners can expect to feast on humble trestle tables, shelter under a rustic corrugated roof and mingle amidst a friendly bunch of pigeons. Meek and unassuming, the Mosque Kitchen boasts unbeatable prices, food of a superlative nature, and will undoubtedly leave you comfortably stuffed for the day ahead.",

Their curries are authentic, slow-cooked, flavoursome and sold in generous portions.  I have been twice, both times having the chicken curry with rice and a naan bread which was tasty and filling.   To order your food you simply walk past the eating area and into a small room where you order your curry canteen-style and then eat it off a plastic plate.  For vegetarians there are a variety of vegetable curries and these, along with the meat and poultry ones, are all served with rice for less than 5. The service is friendly and effective and I like the eating arrangement where you take your food outside and eat it under the plastic roof while chatting with your mates. The Mosque Kitchen offers genuine value for money and is visited each day by people from a huge range of ethnic and national backgrounds - and for good reason too!",

Unlike many traditional curry houses that serve bland, mass produced masalas etc, the Mosque Kitchen has traditional muslim food that (I have been assured by my arabic friends) is what they do eat. The place itself is beautifully grubby, you go into a little kitchen, queue up like in a school canteen then head off outside onto plastic chairs and tables all under a big gazebo. There is nothing refined about the location, the kitchen relies on its food.  And the food is really, really good. There are only 2 curries, chicken and lamb, and while the lamb can be quite stringy, the chicken is always excellent. Think a Korma but less sauce and much more subtly spiced. They also do daal, some form of spinach dish and other dishes I don't recognise as well as kofta kebabs. The rice is absolutely amazing, and the nan breads are huge.  Although the price has gone up a wee bit recently, the Mosque Kitchen is still the cheapest curry place around, with a curry with rice or nan costing only 4.50, and the other dishes less. The guys who work there are really friendly, and it is a great establishment to give your money to.",

Yes when it opened you could get a curry for approximately 0.50 less than the other million surrounding bengali and indian places that populate the area around the mosque.  Oh you also got to eat it out in the freezing cold. AND everything is cooked in vegetable oil. This is touted like it is a good/healthy thing but come on! Everything tastes better in ghee.  People (and by people I mostly mean students and the ill informed) flock to this like like a fly to a metaphor.  Saag out of a tin? - Check Reheated lamb kofta? - Check Disgusting pools of oil? - Check Horrible naan from a packet? - Check  Do yourself a favour and pay the extra 50p to have food cooked a little fresher from one of the myriad of other places that surround this restaurant that actually have people who observe a Halal diet eating in them.  One star for their new digs which are better than sitting out in the cold. When you actually add the things together to get a meal you are paying the same as everywhere else.

The actually dining area isn't anything more then a cafeteria type setting, but there are lots of seats and they can accommodate for larger parties. They have a lot of food places like this in the States, where you basically just go through a line and point to what you want, but this place actually serves decent food.  I opted for the 3 vegetarian curries and rice plate, which was 5 pounds for a big plate of rice and curries. I was really keen on the aubergine, but it must be really popular because they were all out. So I opted for the chickpea, mushroom and potato curries, they do have meat, but none of use tried any. I loved the chickpea curry and the mushrooms as well, but was not a big fan of the potatoes. The chickpeas were way better then I expected and were really well spiced.   Overall, the food was quite spicy, but if you can handle it, it is very enjoyable. The only thing, (which is a personal thing) is that I like greens in my food, or at least for it to have something green in it. The options I had didn't have any peppers, etc, but I did try my boyfriends okra, which was really nice. So they do offer some good 'green' food options. They provided a good portion of food for the price and all up I think we paid 11 pounds for two meals. A great deal for a cheap and fast eat. I wouldn't go for the ambience, but they also do offer take away if you'd like to sit somewhere without florescent lighting or at home. A nice, quick meal for a reasonable price. I don't live in the area, but out of the few Indian places I've tried in Edinburgh, this was the best one.",

    "text": "Loads of people tell me to come here, and I have come here several times.  There are not many options, it is canteen style food, yet the portions are huge, the food is cheap, and this is probably one of the best student meals you will get in the area for the price (especially in terms of quantity).  Being vegetarian, I have always gone for the chickpea curry (chana masala) or the lentil dal with rice. The naan looks decent for the price, plus it's massive. This is a good place to come when you're really hungry and just desperately want to fill up with some food which isn't too bad for you. It's got to be better than kebabs, right?  So, this is definitely not a place for a dinner date... Nor for a sophisticated ritual for ladies who like to lunch.... But it will fill the hole.  If I wanted a normal sized portion, I would go to himalaya cafe just up the road and pay around the same price for a delicious curry. Yes, it's slightly smaller, but the food is very fresh, tasty, and you get salad with your food. All this in a beautifully decorated  cafe, which also offers yoga classes. Himalaya also offer an amazing chai latte, which entices me even more.",

I really enjoy mosque kitchen when it isn't freezing outside (it's outdoor seating although I hear they made an indoor seating). Nevertheless, be it sun or snow this food will most certainly warm you up from the inside. A great choice for some affordable grub at very substantial portions! You can mix and match the mains if you can't decide on a specific curry. Their garlic naan is particularly tasty also! Be warned that lunch times can be very busy as well as swooping pigeons.   Great food at great value.",

    "text": "Ok, so here is the deal, there are TWO Mosque Kitchens.   A couple of months ago I ate at the Mosque Kitchen that is on the corner of Nicholson street and I ... was underwhelmed, to say the least. The quality of the food, meh, the cafeteria-style setting, meh, no clean tables, meh. Didn't like it and couldn't understand for the love of me why people were getting all ravey about it.  Right...... so, get this, if you walk through the front gates of the actual mosque, and walk to the back, there's another Mosque Kitchen, where there is table-service and the food is positively moarish. It's so good, I'm half suspecting them of just drugging me when I get in there, I get so happy.  I have to admit, I now come here about once or twice a week, usually with a colleague. The plates of food you get are just absolutely ridiculous, and the prices are amazingly good. It never fails to keep me full from 13:00 well into 17:30/18:00 which for me is rather important as I get right crabby when I'm hungry. (And by crabby I mean: \"Hey Lou, have you seen that memo I se-,\" Me: \"GRRRRR.\" Colleague: \"Did you just ... growl at me?\" Me: \"KSSSHHHGRRRRR.\")   Ok, so that may not have been the most eloquent explanation, but what I'm trying to get across here is that Mosque Kitchen saved my job, and that, my friends, is a good, good thing.",

I'm not talking about people who'd never been here before (though, word does get around), but people who lived in Edinburgh for a while and counted on the Mosque Kitchen to cure their disproportionate hangover.   I always get the vegetarian options (which have multiplied lately!) which are dahl, rice, greasy spinach with potatoes, chickpeas, and sometimes a vegetable curry. And I think they're definitely the best and cheapest options available. The Mosque Kitchen also sells rubicon and delicious ginger beer to quench your thirst. The people who work there are also real sweet too.",

By 'character', I mean you sit outside under a gazebo in the backyard of Edinburgh Central Mosque, and you eat out of a polystyrene box with a plastic fork. But the food is that good that you won't care about the pigeon eyeing up our lunch 3 feet away.  I usually go for the veggie option, because the one time I did get the chicken there were quite a lot of fatty chewy bits. In fact, it made me stay away from here for a while, but then a veggie friend convinced me to get the lentil and spinach curry instead, and 3 years later I'm still eating there. It's right by the Uni, but you get a surprsing mix of people thanks to it's word-of-mouth reputation.  If you haven't tried it yet, then you need to. Soon.",

The decor is pretty basic although that's to be expected with the low price offer.  None of the  dishes were labelled, a pretty basic shortcoming for a buffet style restaurant. Indeed the first one I've ever been to that you have to make educated guesses on what you're actually eating. Secondly the way they were kept, displayed and the lack of fresh replenishments was abysmal. I haven't seen less desirable food in quite some time. After two plates of what I could safely assume was chicken in different and equally horrible guises I'd had my fill although I was in no way full.  Yes it's ten pounds and it's budget buffet what's your problem I hear you say. I've been to tastier more bountiful buffets for a good four pounds less. I'd rather spend a little bit more cash and go to mother India's cafe or go to flip and have plenty of change in my pocket.",

They serve lunch from 11:30am until 7pm then offer an all you can eat buffet until 11pm.  Please note though that on Fridays they are closed before 12:50-1:50pm for prayer.    Basically, there is no waiting about here so it is the perfect place to go during your lunch hour at work if you want great quality food fast!  Plus, the prices aren't far off what you pay for a sandwich so it really is a winner!  There is no table service so you go up to the hot plate at the back of the restaurant and pick what you'd like to eat.  All the meals are already prepared and just waiting for the taking.    I had 2 Sheekh kebabs with rice (3.50) and my companion had chicken curry and rice (4).  We could not even make a dent in our plates as they were heaped so high with food!  We thought it'd be rude not to get a nan bread to accompany the meal though as at 1 they are practically giving themaway!    This place doesn't serve alcohol because it is part of the Mosque but for all the time you're in there you really don't miss it.  With the quality of food so high and prices so low it really does tick all the boxes.    Great choice for a cheap yet tasty meal.",

    "text": "I was originally going to give the Mosque a solid 5/5 but then I had another think about it and I decided I was going to have to reduce this by 1 star. And here is why. PRO followed by CON.  1) The curry is really tasty - BUT there is more variation in just how tasty it is. Today for example I was a bit dissapointed - the rice was greasy and the chicken lacked flavour.  2) It's Cheap - BUT it's not as cheap as it used to be. The delight was that you could get more food, and a drink faster and cheaper than anywhere else. While it's still pretty much faster and more, there is less than you used to get and you're paying almost 25% more than a few years ago.   3) The Location is good. It's central, on that lovely bit of Edinburgh old town that seems reserved for mentalists and drug users, however it's close to pretty much all of old town and the uni so this is fine.   4) It's chilled out. The guys are cool. They do takeaway and it's ironically an amazing lunch time hangover cure if you're suffering from the night before.   Anyway I've mainly given it 4 start because it's not as good as it used to be and it's gotten more expensive. Saying that I still eat here a couple times a week.   Favourite meal : Meat curry, rice, dahl and veg, witha  can of rubicon guava juice. Sweet.",

I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Mosque Kitchen -- a no-frills, take-away or sit down, \"restaurant\" (I use the quotes because it is super autonomous, noone takes your order). I got the rice plate with the chicken curry and chana masala ( plate of rice, one chicken curry & one veg 'topping' ) for 6 pounds. I added on a huge naan for an extra pound. This was more than enough food for me! I got the chance to try what I wanted with both rice and naan.   The process works as follows: you walk into the establishment, head over to the back where you will find a buffet line with all different types of veg and non veg (chicken, lamb) dishes. You tell the server what you would like. You pay. You seat yourself. You feast.  If you want tea or a dessert you stop by the area in the middle of the establishment and let the employee there know what you would like.   I got the chai for 2.5 pounds and I felt like that was a bit too pricey for the chai -- which had the chai taste but was watered down with milk. It did the job, but not in a satisfactory manner.   All in all, LOTS of affordable food with a GOOD amount of flavor -- definitely stop by for lunch/dinner!",

The bare and simple style of the place is part of the reason it can be as cheap as it is.  So it's pretty cheap. And that's lovely. For the price you pay here, you get a decent amount of food and a warmish place to sit during the day. It's a shame the food is so-so.  I've only had the \"Green curry with mixed vegetables\" so far, and it was pretty sad. Some curry sauce with peas and carrots splashed onto a huge bed of bland rice. I had mine with garlic bread (eh. It was fine) but I should definitely have had the \"extra vegetable topping\" addon instead, because the rice-to-veg ratio was pretty dismal.  The taste of the curry itself was fine, but the lack of any diversity of texture and taste in the veg that came in it meant that I left feeling full but not satisfied.  The price is what keeps Mosque Kitchen up there at the three, as it's difficult to beat that price, but it's such a cheap experience in every other aspect as well that I can't honestly recommend it. It was fine, but if you can afford to go elsewhere, I'd suggest you do.",

    "text": "The Mosque Kitchen is an adequate restaurant which does the job it sets out to do: \"tasty curry in a hurry\". If you're in a rush, you can be in and out in 10 minutes, no problem. I've been here many times with friends, and generally enjoy the food. Service isn't very friendly, and I often find it difficult to get a glass of water. I wish they would just leave some out in a jug for people to use. There is a variety of curries, both with meat and without, and the portions are quite large for the low prices charged. There are loads of seats, so it should never be a problem to find seating. Overall, a worthwhile place to come for a quick, cheap, and tasty meal.",

    "text": "During a recent trip to the Edinburgh Fringe I developed a bit of an obsession with the Mosque Kitchen. Canteen style, simple menu with choice of veg curries or chicken or lamb as well as sheesh and biryani.  5 for rice and 3 veg curries or chicken plus a veg. You can make your own combination. Most importantly, the food itself is excellent. Perfect basmati rice with some aromatics. I recommend the aubergine and pepper curry, meltingly soft and delicious as well as the channa and dahl. The standard chicken curry is also excellent with super tender chicken. Add ons include samosas and naan bread and probably some other options.  Food is served at the counter, you pay, take your plate and find a seat with the other diners.  We had lunch there every day and wish I had a branch near me. I've been trying to make my own versions of their curries, inspired as I was. Not bad but can't come close.  A perfect no-nonsense, no pretence, no fuss, great food and great value eatery.",

    "text": "Pretty standard Indian food with big portions. I went with the standard option of the chicken tikka masala - it was mostly rice and sauce with maybe four pieces of chicken. Convenient for a quick informal lunch but nothing special. Looks more like a cafeteria than a restaurant.",

    "text": "I love the Mosque Kitchen! been heap of times and will continue to go back because it's just really good food, fantastically cheap and friendly lovely staff!  Went again last night - in between fringe festival shows - yes there was a wealth of food stalls around George Square but nothing took our fancy and decided to opt for filling, wholesome, big portion great value food at the Mosque.  It was really busy (a victim of its own success and location) but staff were apologetic, helpful and did everything they could to keep the food coming and get everyone served as soon as possible.   If you haven't been before you may find the Mosque Kitchen a little rustic - for me this part of the charm... The Kitchen is situated in the grounds of the Mosque with access from West Nicolson Street and Nicolson Square. The seating area is outside, but under cover - basic, tables and chairs, no frills but clean and adequate for eating your meal.   Don't expect table service - you will go into the cafe area, where you can pick from and array of dishes, cooked and ready to serve, cafeteria style, pay, sit, eat, enjoy!   The food is just delicious! There is normally a lamb curry, chicken curry and at least two veggie curry options, rice, naan bread and some sides. Portions are generous.   Last night I had a minced lamb curry with rice and a meat samosa. My friend went for the Vegetable Curry, opting for half and half of each. I paid less than a fiver! It was delicious, chocked full of vegetables and extremely filling.   Will be back again soon!",
