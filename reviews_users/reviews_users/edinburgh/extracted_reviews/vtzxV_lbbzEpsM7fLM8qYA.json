    "text": "Went on a Tuesday night for a friend's birthday dinner. I had never been, but the others said it's a regular spot for them, and I can understand why! The couches and armchairs are clean and comfy, and the place itself is just really charming. There was sweet, accoustic-type music on (at an appropriate volume!), there were a few other guests sitting around the place, and we were just generally very comfy.  My favorite thing, though, about this place? The staff! They were so friendly and sweet, and they do their jobs well. They brought hot, good comfort food (at an affordable price for a student!), checked on us for refills often enough (but not too much), and were just a pleasure to be around.  I'm really excited to go back to this place--don't know how it gets on busier nights of the week, but it was perfect for what I'm looking for after a typical weekday. :)",

I saw two gents standing with their drinks and offered them the extra seats at my table. I would have picked a smaller table for two but they were all taken. But I'm happy I didnt as I got to have a great conversation for several hours. No gluten free beer but there is cider, wines, and they do have great gin and fever tree tonics. Staff was kind and though busy, they did their best to serve food in a timely manner and let people know when seats were opening up.",

    "text": "On the 30th of May I walked into The Hermitage Bar at dinner time. I looked at the menu, I ordered an Innis & Gunn beer and a chicken and ham hock pie with crushed peas. The beer was good and refreshing. The pie was tasty. It consisted of puff pastry filled with a white cream and plenty of ham. At first it was yummy but after a while its appeal started to decline (I am a fairly big fan of pies - maybe it was the ham hock flavor which is a little different so I don't know). The crust was good but it was somewhat burned, indication that something did not go right in the kitchen (too much time or too much temperature). Please note that the pie typically comes with chips but since you get that just about everywhere in Scotland, I asked for the peas instead. The tall blonde lady that poured the beer behind the counter cut the foam dripping from the side of my glass of beer with her fingers. I did not like that since that's where I put my lips and her fingers are not necessarily clean (use a knife or something else instead). I paid attention to the glasses she poured after mine and she never did it again after that (I still wonder why). The Hermitage Bar is a gastropub and not a restaurant. The selection of food is rather limited and some drinks are extremely overpriced (just look behind the bar).",

I don't know what changed in their hiring policies but the staff went from being alright to being really nice, friendly and interactive.   It's the little things that make this local just a wee bit friendlier!",

We tried the muscles & frites, and the chicken piccata with asparagus. Delicious!! They have all the beer and cocktails you could ever want. The owners are a delight. You'll be glad you came here!",

    "text": "Had been there, 2 years ago, when it was called Morningside Glory and I gave it 2 stars, mainly due to poor customer service. Well, on my return this week I rediscover an all rounded, new and much better approach & concept for the bar. As I was meeting with an ex-colleague I ordered the Cumberland Sausage and Mash, 3 sausages and a very yummy mash indeed, great treat. My friend ordered a chicken burger (that is because they ran out of beef burgers) the skin-on-potatoes chips were sublime and crispy, the way it should always be, all washed down with a couple of pints (Schiehallion & and the less original Stella Artois)... But the massive improvement it has been the excellent customer service, attentive, sincerely friendly even though the place was full with happy people. Kudos to the manager and all the great staff, stay al dente Hermitage crowd!!!",

(Typical pub grub, i.e fish and chips, burgers etc).  Mostly male clientele when I visited ...due to football (they have sky sports).  All and all a nice place for a quick drink if you are in the area.",

Not much of an atmosphere and not much chat from the bar staff. They do have a few comfy couches dotted about the place and it would probably be a lot more chilled out if it wasn't so busy when I went in.  If you're after a quick drink on your way out/home or need a starting place for a night out in this area then you can't go wrong, but there are far better pubs in the area.",

I ordered a panini and chips for a fiver that filled a hole and had a chinwag on a comfy chesterfield sofa. All A OK.   Football was on, which was a bit annoying. But this seems to be a local boozer where all the guys watch the sports while glued to their chairs, so that's fair enough.   Decor wise it's all quite modern and airy. Looked nice. Loos were clean. Service was good. Would probably come back here, but not all that inspiring for some reason.",

The service is super-friendly (this seems to be consistent--we stopped in for a pint one afternoon a week ago to scope it out, and the staff are as happy to see you when the place is heaving, as they are when it's empty). The food is *amazing*--fresh,  well-made, and with enough variety to please our party, which included a vegetarian and a picky eater. The beer selection is excellent, too. Looking forward to going back soon.",

The staff is amazing beer selection is awesome and a little cheaper than some of the places in been to. This will be a place I hang out at quite a lot I think. Worth a stop in anyway. Come try it out and enjoy a laid back pub that is friendly to groups, couples, and loners. Hermitage!",
