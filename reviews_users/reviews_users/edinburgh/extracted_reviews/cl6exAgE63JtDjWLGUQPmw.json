I chose the lentil soup and grilled maple salmon with risotto with asparagus -  what I got was barely booked vegetables in the soup (hard) with cold butter to slab on my bread, and salmon on a overly creamy sauce with tiny pieces of asparagus.. Both dishes didn't taste that great so didn't feel it was worth the 12.  There's a very cozy and well decorated seating area downstairs and a couple tables outdoors, and the music is cool.  Good for drinks but not a meal in my opinion.",

On the corner of a quiet street, it reminds you of a parisian cafe on a sunny Saturday morning, as people sit outside, enjoying one of the best coffees in town. The space inside is bright and nicely decorated with a retro flair. It's small, so you might want to go downstairs, where you'll find yet again a totally different world: A dim and cosy hideaway with massive chairs, raw brick walls and old furniture. Perfect to bring your book and forget about the outside world.  The food is great. I personally love the chorizo salad, their dressing deserves a special praise. There's also full monty scottish breakfast, eggs, quiches, paninis and pancakes - everything you'd expect from an enchanted cafe like this. Sweets are great too. I'd go for the caramel shortbread.",

As a freelancer my favourite perch is at a large-ish table downstairs. During the day it's nice and quiet. The Wi-fi is strong and fast, and you're out of the way of the hustle and bustle. Outside is my (and everyone else's) favourite on a sunny day. You're set back from the road and can just enjoy watching the world go by while catching a tan. The food is quite tasty too. I've only partaken of the daytime menu so far, which is mostly all-day breakfasts, brunches, salads and sandwiches. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming. It's the perfect little neighbourhood cafe.",

I want to be welcomed into a place but find this guy just does as he pleases with no regard for his customers.  The last straw was when I nearly tripped over the cable coming out of the front door and across the pavement!  The guy didn't seem to care whatsoever!  Like I said, the food has generally been pretty good, but it is really small, better for summer than winter with a fair few of the tables being outside.  I never really liked being down in the basement.  A pity, what could be a great wee local cafe is ruined by the attitude of the owner.",

The owner, I believe, used to be Chef for the Montpellier Group - so knows his stuff & it definitely shows...when he's there!    Atmosphere is cool, relaxed & a great wee hideaway (they also have a beautician who shares the space out the back - DEFINITELY recommend!).  I introduced quite a few people to this corner of the community & 90% of the time it was a hit!  The food was extremely generous, and the coffee great!  So... it is with great despair that I give it a 3 stars - however, when the owner is not there 1 of the waitresses will put together your brunch, your panini etc.... and this is where the problems have arisen as she is not a trained chef, or even a kitchen hand!  On receiving \"bowl shaped\" scrambled eggs - she mentioned \"I don't really know how to work the microwave\" ...   If you go in for food, and there is not the male chef downstairs ... walk back out. Always a safe option if you are just there for tea or coffee ....",

It's actually been a godsend to me in recent weeks, as, faced with tight deadlines from work and the absence of internet in my flat, I've been desperately seeking somewhere that serves good coffee, is open early, and has reliable wi-fi.  You wouldn't think that combination of factors would be so difficult to find, but in my part of town I've been struggling.  And then I stumbled across this tiny cafe/bar in Montgomery Street, and it was Renroc to the rescue!  Other reasons I like it are its continental feel, with tables outside that are always packed on sunny days, the friendly staff,stylish decor, and range of simple but classy food.  It's not super cheap, and in fact seems to have a clientele exclusively made up of wealthy, eating-out-for-breakfast types, but it's very nice all the same.",

My moan problem what with the food and drink. I order a white Americano, orange juice and eggs benedict with salmon (I believe some call it eggs royal). Firstly I could tell just by looking that the hollandaise sauce came from a jar which made me a bit sad, then I had a sip of my orange juice and it was right on the cusp of going BAD (a bit of a fizz to it and the feeling had you waited a couple more day it could have been more like a mimosa with fermentation). I always feel badly when the service is great and the food is lacking. I ate all the benedict and sadly resigned myself to the fact that the sauce was indeed from a jar, drank the juice that made me sad and happily sucked down the nice coffee and read about the olympics with their handy wifi. Honestly, I wanted to write something great about the place but if anything I would advise you stick to coffee or something that is more reliable.",

The original cafe was based on the cafe's you found on corners across Amsterdam and Paris and on a warm Sunny day you really feel like you are somewhere on the continent with loads of tables outside taken up by hip couples, families and locals.   They also have a good beer and wine collection with a couple of drafts and plenty of choice in bottles. The food ranges from Italian inspired Chorizo Stromboli to vegetarian dishes, bacon rolls, French pastries and everything delicious in between.   The cafe is great for kids with a children's menu (including baby-cino) and high chairs for small children.   Inside the upstairs is deli-esque but then you go down the winding staircase to the bohemian downstairs which used to be an old bakery and comes complete with the old baker's oven still a feature in the walls.   Renroc doubles up as a gallery showcasing local artists and also have a health spa called Nevo attached to it. During the festival there were some great free fringe shows held here too.   I cannot talk highly enough of the place. It really is worth going out of your way for. Take the time to find it and I guarantee you'll go back!",
