    "text": "Byron was the only place that was still serving food when we needed dinner around 21:00 on a weekday in Edinburgh (they serve food until 22:00). We were so grateful they were still open! The mac and cheese balls were really good but they did NOT need to be drenched in the buffalo/cheese sauce. They get a bit soggy if you don't eat them right away...It would be better if the sauce was on the side and they weren't swimming in them.  I got a salad which sounds basic, I know, but it was surprisingly delicious. Broccolini, edamame, cranberries, avocado, and mixed greens. Walnuts would've been good too but they were not included. The dressing was light and tangy (got it on the side). My boyfriend got a burger (I forgot the name but he liked it but said he's had better). He probably thought it was decent because we were so hungry at the time...But the fries that it came with were good and cooked perfectly. Overall, a nice place if you want some American food in Scotland, but not anything to rave about.",

They're yummy and tasty, they're big and filling they're everything you want from a proper burger and they are not cheap but you definitely get your money's worth. They only negative I have to say is it's cold in this restaurant and there were no desserts available but",

It was, and not dry. My only complaint: their \"Byron cheese\" almost had a Velveeta-ish type texture. The fries (Not chips!) tasted fresh, and I am loving my Oreo shake. My buddy is enjoying his whiskey milkshake concoction.   Delicious taste of home when 7000 miles away...",

What they've done with these premises is very good (swiveled the kitchen round to gain a lot more seating space) but should you really be noticing that if the overall experience is any good?  Menu-wise other similar outlets in the city have more to offer so, whilst I've no quibbles about the quality of the product on offer, I don't see myself venturing back.",

    "text": "I went to Byron with 4 of my work colleagues on their 25p burger special opening offer day. The queue was down the street as you would imagine, but it moved quickly and we were in and seated in no time.   We were in one of the big booth seats by the window (which are perfect for people watching)  The staff were friendly and super knowledgeable which was great as I ask a lot of questions. So I'm vegetarian and am so pleased that here they have separate fryers for their chips and courgette chips than their meat products (I'm amazed at how this still happens elsewhere)   They were also clued up with veggie friendly cheeses and don't use Parmesan in their veggie dishes (it's not veggie)   The open kitchen is a nice touch, I like seeing how the kitchen works.   My Portobello mushroom burger with goats cheese, red peppers and spinach was super tasty, as we're the courgette chips. I very much enjoyed my lunch and would come back here again.   I find it a little strange when you buy your burger then the chips are extra, I'd rather it was standard and you upgraded to sweet potato chips or courgette chips if you wanted to.   Nice industrial decor.   Worth a visit",
