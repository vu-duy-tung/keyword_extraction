This is a lovely baked potato shop. A large range of various fillings and three sizes of potato depending on your hunger! There are a few stools inside  enough for about 8 people. There is also an excellent range of hot and cold drinks and soup. The baked potato I had was yummy  together with a lovely cheese filling. The soup was superb value. Thick and satisfying and only 90 pence! Service was fast and special mention of the owner  a really charming Italian guy. Will be back! :-)",

I ordered a regular size \"tattie\" and you can choose from about 25 different toppings.  I got cheese, and curry chicken.  I was surprised with how good it actually was.  The man behind the counter was also very helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend this place for a good, quick meal that's very affordable.  I would definitely return again for another \"tattie\" if I'm in Edinburgh again in the future.  The location is pretty central, right off the Royal Mile on a little side street.  It's easy to spot with the bright red sign.  :)",

    "text": "Let's be honest, we've all been tempted by a tattie.  Tempting tattie aims to exploit your primeval urge for filled baked potato. This is a better than average, easy lunch option. Like the many sandwich and baguette shops that have sprung up, the idea here is to choose your own filling from a wide range. Here you can choose a small, medium or large portion, costing you around 3.50, 4.20 or 5.00 respectively. Whilst there is a wide range of preselected combinations (basically of two ingredients) you can also choose to creatively construct your very own tattie.  Amongst the other reviewers there seems to be a bit of a debate on the issue of cheese. I have to say I wasn't that impressed by it either. I'm quite picky about my dairy, and I really don't like mega-processed plastic cheese with a greasy film. Unfortunately I've come to expect it from most places.  But you don't really expect fine cuisine from a shop like Tempting Tattie, so if a quick, filling and reasonably priced potato is your cup of tea, try this place.  Incidentally they do also offer cheaper than average but decent paninis and mediocre soup, so its not all tatties at Tatties.",

He tends to boycott some flavours, to the point where I once made him a cheese toastie for breakfast (last week), and he sent it back (because I used Kraft cheese slices).  So don't listen to the cheesy lies! I quite liked the cheese in here - it's not as bad as all that, and it melts nicely. There are some good old fashioned baked potato toppings you can get, including tuna, sweetcorn and some Scottish haggis that the tourists will go nuts over. While I always opt for minimal fillings, I always appreciate how well the potatoes are made in here. They crumble in your mouth like yer gran made them. Lovely stuff. As Stephanie said your nostrils will lead the way, since this place smells delectable from around the block!",

I would argue that the smells wafting out of Tempting Tattie would weaken the knees of the most upstanding gentleman/lady.  They have a great selection of fillings - everything you would expect from a baked potato shop. The potatoes themselves are nothing short of perfect - exactly how a tattie should be. I loved the tuna mayo and sweetcorn, it's really chilled and so works well with the steamy potato. My friend just had cheese and she said it was the best baked potato she'd ever had.",

Whilst I'm a big fan of Tempting Tattie, I have to admit I usually steer clear of most of the flavour combinations and opt for a small or medium spud with simple butter, salt and pepper. I couldn't eat haggis if you paid me and the cheese that TT serve is so flurescent and cheap looking it hurts my eyes, nevermind my tastebuds. Still, the tatties themselves are pretty good!",

I'm honestly not so sold on putting some of those things (tuna & sweetcorn? really?) in a potato, but you can get just about anything in a potato. And nothing else.

One detail that usually wouldn't be a problem in any other take away, but cheese holds everything together in a good baked potato. A good cheese might have made up for dodgy haggis Gavin had.",

    "text": "I wouldn't quite call my 2 experiences at Tempting Tattie a case of hit and miss, but after my frankly tremendous first baked potato, I was a bit miffed that the second wasn't so much tempting as vomit-inducing.  I'll start with the good one. Unbelievably fluffy inside, cooked to perfection with crispy skin, and with a generous helping of (admittedly a bit rubbery) cheddar on the inside. Five stars all the way.  On visit number two, I opted to be a bit aventurous and put a bit of haggis into the mix. Now haggis doesn't look the most attractive at the best of times, but this tattie quite literally looked liked a dog had been sick on it. It didn't taste too horrific, but it's perhaps telling that since this menu mis-step I've never felt tempted to return.  that's what you get for mixing haggis and cheddar cheese. Once the memory of that schoolboy error fades, I'll gladly give Tempting Tattie another go.",

We had just had lunch when I first noticed this wee place, but on my second visit I made sure I had plenty room for a baked potato from here.  Good things really do come in small packages, and this place was mobbed when I went, we couldn't get in the door! After waiting patiently for about 15 minutes we got to the front of the queue. I decided on a macaroni cheese filling for mine (a bit wierd and carbed to the highest, I know) It was massssssive! They must have some sort of mutant allotment where these giganta-tatties grow! The Mac inside was delicious, but I found myself really struggling to get through it! Safe to say I was full to bursting and very satisfied. Something about a nice baked tattie makes you all warm inside, definitely a home comfort!  Probably the best baked potato shop in the land. Trust me.",
