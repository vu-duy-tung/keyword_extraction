    "text": "On my birthday adventure Angela B and I were spoiled for choice for cafes to stop in for our lunch. We had looked at a few menus but some were a bit too expensive and then we popped into one affordable one but it was absolutely stowed with no seats left.   We swiftly moved along and came across here. It only had one review at the time and it sounded OK. When we entered there was only one customer on her laptop so there was plenty of seats and we spied one right at the window.   We headed up to the counter and it was a, I presume Spanish girl, serving. We had perused the menu on the wall and we both decided on the soup and sandwich deal at 6.50. It was a little dearer than the cafe we had just came from but hey we got a choice of seats, so wasn't too fussed.   There was so many options of soups and sandwiches to choose from. I opted for the Winter Veg & Lentil with a Brie & Cranberry Sauce sandwich and for an extra 40p I got some ham. Yum! She asked if I would like it toasted, hell to the yeah.   I also ordered a mocha and glass of tap water. We didn't wait long and we were presented with lovely lunch in quaint mugs. The sandwich was more of a roll and it was brioche. Bonus, my favourite!   The food was lovely, the coffee was spot on and service was good. The place does look as though it's going though some renovation as the ceiling was, well a bit under construction. It didn't interfere with our lunch and we had a pleasant experience so I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "Whilst in the 'Burgh on Elizabeth's F's Birthday Adventure Day we popped into here for some much needed food and for me, caffeine fix. I really liked the look of the place from the outside and inside it had that rustic-meets-Scandinavian feel to it. I think they must be mid-renovation as there were still some very 'rustic' parts to the cafe!   We both opted for the Soup & Sandwich deal for 6.50 which considering this is Rose Street, in the capital/Edinburgh, isn't too bad a deal. We sat at a lovely round window table and I did notice it was a wee bit chilly but I think that may have been because we were sat right beside the window on a rather cold day.   The lady serving was very pleasant and helpful. I ordered the Winter Veg & Lentil soup (I LOVE lentils!), a tuna mayo sandwich and also a soya flat white and obligatory glass of tap water. Afterwards I noticed they had a Cortado on their menu and I wish I had ordered that as it is a favourite of mine & hardly ever on a coffee menu here. Next time.  The service was swift & the soup arrived in a cute (big) mug & it was delicious. The sandwich was more a roll but it was still very nice (if maybe a little dry). My coffee was really good (if maybe a wee bit too large for a flat white) but unfortunately we were running a bit late (or so we thought...) so I never managed to finish it all. But it was a really tasty and strong flat white, considering the size of glass it was served in. Thumbs up.  I went to the bathroom whilst in here and it was the cutest wee loo! Nice to see it fully stocked with LOTS of loo roll & the water from the taps was so lovely and hot ~ how often do you go to wash your hands in a place and the Hot tap is in fact freezing or takes ages to heat up or (worse) scalding hot! This was a perfect temperature to clean all those hand bugs off as a woman I used to work with in a Microbiology lab used to say :-)  Lovely atmosphere, friendly service, nice food, really good coffee & a cute wee toilet. If I'm in Edinburgh again I would deffo come back.",

    "text": "Stopped here for a quick pick me up coffee whist shopping and from the outside this place looked promising with it's cute rustic signage. I was greeted by a lovely young lady who was friendly and bubbly and ordered a flat white and a slice of caramel shortcake. The interior here is somewhat basic and half the ceiling is exposed and in need of repair which doesn't look good at all. My coffee arrived and I have to say I was disappointed it didn't look or taste very nice in fact quite bitter, on the plus side though my caramel shortcake was yummy:) I wouldn't go back here for coffee as it's not their strong point which is a shame and somewhat misleading as they advertise as a coffee shop. Perhaps they would do better as a sandwich shop as they seem to have good deals on at lunchtime and would attract the rose street crowd.",

    "text": "I'm a stickler for having good reasons for giving less than 3 starts. Most of the time I give 4 or above. However I was really disappointed at Latitude the other week. SO let's have a run down. (I will be going back in the coming weeks to check it out again as I believe in second chances!) Good and bad included. I've included a RAG status at the end for urgancy  1) Decor - Stripped back should be tasteful. This reminded me of some of my old student flats crossed with an office I had in a lockup under a railway line (though there were no rats at the coffee place I hasten to add!), with raw MDF and bare walls it felt impersonal and uncared for. (R)  2) Kitchen/serving area - I quite liked the way it was set up - solid stuff, Keep that up.  (G)  3) What do I do when I arrive. Sit down? Goto the bar? Is it table service. It wasn't clear - not sure how you're going to solve that one, but have a think. (A)   4) Coffee selection - Standard selection on offer so why not try and do something different? (A)   5) Coffee look - WOW THOSE ARE BIG FOR A CORTADO AND FLAT WHITE. Seriously I've had smaller cappuccinos and lattes and all served in the same glasses. For the cortados I recommend 100ml Piccollos 5 for 6 online.  (R)   6) Coffee Taste - Decent taste from the espresso lingering but just so much of it and the milk was (IMHO) slightly too hot, which combined with the size meant that I struggled to drink it. I drink flat whites because I want a quick pick me up, not a milky sleep inducing mug of soup. (R)   Cakes did look good but I didn't try them.   So number one have a think about the size of the coffee glasses and servings.   I had high hopes due to the location, but things just didn't add up. Will come back soon and try again!",

Luckily there was one table left in the middle. Score! It did feel very cramped, as they have the smallest tables sat very close to each other. A bit confused as to whether it was table service or not, I went to the bar where a lovely girl took my order. The staff is great; friendly and fast. I decided on rhubarb tea, a new one for me, and a cheddar scone. The tea came quickly and so did the scone. The scone was heated, 'yum' I thought!  Wrong! It was microwaved and therefore piping hot and mushy. I would've much rather had a cold scone than this.  As others have commented, the decor is minimal and looks like the ceiling is in dire need of repair. It's a shame because this place had lots of potential! I will probably not be back..",

There was a huge list to choose from for both and they were unusual options too..so much different to what you usually see offered in coffee shops. I had the brie and cranberry sandwich on brioche bread with the sweetcorn and cheddar soup. Both were really yummy and I shall be making both at home. I also had the sweet rhubarb tea which was delicious...it was by taylors and was a fruit tea that was unusually very flavoursome :)",
