    "text": "If you like authentic Korea food, Ong Gie is a great choice and very reasonably priced.  I've spent a lot of time in South Korea and the friendly owner makes real tasty authentic food, I really recommend the bulgogi, yang yam chicken and bi-bimbap. The Haggis-kimchee spring rolls are amazing and the makkoli (traditional Korean rice wine) is a great way to wash down a meal with something you won't get to drink many places.  The place is pretty small, just 2-3 tables upstairs, but there is a room downstairs with more room as well.   Some of my friends who live nearby Ong Gie often get take away from there as well, a great option if you live nearby.",

    "text": "Ong Gie is a decent Korean takeaway situated near Buccleuch Place and offers friendly service and good food, although the prices aren't really that cheap.  I came here with some mates in December last year as an interesting alternative to the usual Indian or Chinese takeaways and we certainly weren't disappointed by the quality of the food.  Korean food is similar to Chinese and Japanese cuisine, yet there are more things like kebabs and dumplings.  I went for the barbecued beef which was served in a delcious mild sauce with fried rice. The food didn't take long to be prepared and was filling as well as tasty.  It did cost about 10 per person though, which isn't cheap considering it was just a takeaway. Ong Gie is an excellent Korean eatery, but it comes at a price to match.",

    "text": "Claiming to be the only Korean restaurant in Edinburgh, Ong Gie is situated very close to the universities central library.  The food here is ecclectic and suprisingly good- I really wasnt sure what to expect with Korean food having never had it before, but it is tasty and the menu also has a nice balance of vegetarian and meat dishes to keep everybody happy. The prices are also reasonable, but getting your food (either delivered or for you to pick up) is a tad on the slow side.  Other than that, Ong Gie isnt a bad place to go to - and being the only Kerean restaurant in Edinburgh, it certainly has a unique selling point.",

    "text": "There is now more than one place to acquire Korean food in Edinburgh. But not many. Ong Gie is one of them.  A fairly new addition to the Southside area, Ong Gie has some competition, considering the number of takeaways and restaurants nearby, for its mostly student clientele. Near to George Square and the main library, many a student will pass this takeaway on their way home from evening study. Being something a bit different gives Ong Gie somewhat of an advantage.  Not bad for a lazy takeaway, especially if you want something a bit different, but with room for improvement.  I've tried takeaway from here a couple of times and its always been okay. There is a reasonable menu, with quite a variety to choose from but once it arrives its not always as exciting as the menu make it out to be. Service can be a little slow but on the whole the staff are friendly.  This gives Ong Gie",

    "text": "Ong Gie, where did it go wrong?  I love Korean food, and as one of two places that I know of in Edinburgh and the surrounding area, I have to love you. But it is a tainted love I have now. I had driven past you on so many occasions, but never stopped, until last night.   As a cash only establishment, you kindly directed me to the nearest cashpoint (sadly hidden by a number of fire engines, but no matter) and as I leave, apologise for not being able to take cards. So sweet!  After I order way way too much food, you give me a cup of brown rice green tea - a favourite of mine and delicious on a cold night and a free bottle of coke.   I race home. It's a good 20-30min drive and I want my food to be at least warm on arrival. Ong Gie do do a delivery service but not I suspect, to the far reaches of East Lothian. Time is indeed, of the essence.   Good news! I get home, and the kimchi jeaon is still hot! (pancake with kimchi, a pickled cabbage). It's an odd colour, due to the red dying the pancake, and an odd texture, but not bad.   I also ordered haggis and kimchi spring rolls for the boy, I couldn't resist.   For the main, I ordered bibimbab for me (a rice dish with vegetables and a fried egg) and asked for some kimchi to be added. I love me some kimchi. For the boy, I went with the recomendation of deep fried prawns with chilli sauce. I also grabbed a side of beansprouts in a spicy sauce.   Beansprouts were delicious, a little salty and in a giant tray, so the portion itself while fine looked tiny in such a big tray.   The bibimbab, marked as vegetarian in the menu, turned out to have beef, and no kimchi. No bibimbab for me, then. Luckily as the boy had fish, we were able to swap. Bibimbab was too spicy for him, and I didn't like the prawns - the batter was soggy. This would not have been my first choice.   So I shake my finger at you for getting the bibimbab so wrong. It was never supposed to have meat in it, and how does that get confused with kimchi, especially when I couldn't see anything else that resembled the dish on the menu? Being that I was 25mins away, there was no point calling up to complain or go back. I want to like you Ong Gie, but it will be a while before I face up to trying you out again, even though you were so very nice to me. As a wise yelper once said, you never feed meat to a vegetarian (or pescatarian).",

    "text": "I accept that it's had very favourable reviews but it is infact one of the poorest take aways Ive ever had. My girlfirend ordered the chicken curry which consisted of chicken cubes in a watery sauce that tasted like those artiificial curry sachets you get with curry and chips. I ordered deep fried chicken in a soy glaze with a hint of chilli but there was no flavour at all apart from oil, salt and gloopy onions. The chicken itself was very small chicken drumsticks with no meat on them. so overall it felt like what we ordered wasnt what we got and what we did get wasnt good quality.",

Anyway, Korean food is lovely if you haven't tried it, alot fresher tasting than Chinese or Japanese food, a nice moist flavor (which sounds off but you'll know when you taste)  This place is ok if you are in the area, but a little bit expensive for what you're actually getting.",

    "text": "Ong Gie is an amazing little takeaway in Edinburgh. Not only is the service offered by the family that runs the place super-friendly and speedy, but the food is high quality and True to the korean style. For me, of East Asian descent, it was a welcome change to discover Ong Gie when it opened up last year (2009-10 academic year). Any one who wants delicious, authentic Korean food should definitely try this place out. You'll love the experience.   But note, it  may not for everybody: the flavours are unique, and sometimes very spicy. I suspect that many bland British tongues won't be able to cope. Neil G was right in saying the Bimbimbab was delicious - and, Catriona C., it IS supposed to come with meat in it. At least according to every Korean I've ever met and, seeing as I lived in Little Korea, that's probably more than you. Take your bland vegetarian-pescatarian tastebuds elsewhere and stop feeding children spicy food.  If you're adventurous and you love good food, then you'll love Ong Gie.",

Try the national dish of bibimbad for an economic and colourful tasty and fulfilling meal. They even offered to make things not on the menu if you aren't satisfied! What can I say. Glorious and right next to an awesome bar too. Win!",
