We had a tasty sandwich and yummy, warm soup. The staff was very friendly and accommodating even though it was packed with people enjoying their pints. The ale I had was refreshing and went down easy. We thought it was very reasonably priced. All in all, it was an excellent Scottish Pub experience.",

The whiskey selections were great and their menu of other drinks was quite diverse, so everyone will find something they like at Ensign Ewart.  ... AND ...

Its quite a snug place and if you can bag somewhere to sit then its your lucky day.  We didn't eat in the pub, but food is served which looks like your standard pub fare. Its a pleasant spot to while away an hour and eavesdrop on the conversations of your close neighbours. Understandably its very popular with tourists.  The loos at the Ensign Ewart are locked, but fear not, there's no need to get caught short. When ordering drinks at the bar the staff lean forward and whisper the keypad code. A canny solution to non-customers trying to use the facilities!",

We've been in a bunch of places that were on various \"Best Pubs\" list, and most were overrun by tourists, had poor quality beer, and/or little character. Then, last night, after fleeing one such establishment, we happened into a cozy, unassuming little place right on Lawnmarket St. called The Ensign Ewart. It was a pleasant surprise, given the throngs of crowds outside, and the fact that most of the more \"showy\" pubs up and down the street are overcrowded and noisy. Does it have a dozen tellies blasting the sport du jour? No.  Is it on everyone's \"Ten Best Pubs in Edinburgh\" list?  No.  Does it serve haggis nachos?  No. Is it cozy, comfortable, friendly, and traditional?  Yes!  Does it serve cask ale?  Yes!  Is it a pleasant easy-going place to relax and enjoy a few quality cask ales. Absolutely!",

Visually the pub ticked most of the right boxes for me; dimly lit with a lovely old fashioned woody decor to it.  I wasn't that impressed with my pint of Caledonian 80 though. Could have been unlucky but I couldn't help wondering if such a handy location for snaring tourists (guilty) was responsible for a lazy attitude to the beer as well as being the reason for the London prices.  Named after a legendary soldier who is buried nearby (there is a monument).",

Sadly, it doesn't live up to the standard of other pubs on the Royal Mile. Serving a variety of British beers at reasonable prices, considering its location, Ensign Ewart seems to aim mainly at tourists. One big annoyance is a pin-code lock on the bathroom door, forcing you to check at the bar before going to the toilet.  To be honest the place has a slightly tacky feel, between the claymores and the Culloden portraits it feels as if Mel Gibson's Braveheart were turned into a pub and dumped in the centre of Edinburgh",

It's got low ceilings, a load of pub paraphernalia (bits and bob of pictures etc) and they serve a really great range of good beers and ales. The staff don't glare you down, which is always a plus.   Even though it's on the Royal Mile, it's still refreshingly quaint, and though it can be jammed with tourists, it still feels like a bit of an oasis from the blaring bagpipes and endless tat of the Royal Mile (once you've lived in Edinburgh long enough, the Royal Mile sometimes becomes a place to avoid, especially during the Festival).   Definitely a solid pub, if you're in that part of town, a part of town which seems to lack any good places to sit down for a drink. They serve food, but sadly, I haven't had a chance to taste any yet. But it's pretty standard pub food.",

I think there was only one waitress working the whole pub so service was slow, but she was doing her best and was perfectly polite and helpful. We were still in and out in a reasonable amount of time.  I had a cup of tea (which, to my surprise, came with a piece of Scottish tablet!) and the venison casserole, which was like a hearty crock of venison, potatoes, and cheese all baked together. It was hot, tasty and had me ready for the evening and walking tour.   Take note that there is not a large menu here, so either check beforehand or don't be too choosey. Also be aware that there is limited seating and service may not be lightning fast. If you keep all that in mind, you're in for a nice meal!",

We managed to stumble, literally, upon this establishment as we were taking cover from the sudden downpour threatening to dampen our day. The first place that seemed to have hot food and dry seats along the way down, Ensign Ewart sure delivered more than we expected!  Jackets flying off everywhere, we were placed at a table near the back. It was kind of cramped and there was a door to the right of me. I was wondering where it would lead to and why my seat was right by that door. Fortunately, after asking where the bathroom was, I discovered that it was just an arm's length away through that door! Lucky!  After moving to another table near the bar, I quickly ordered an ale since I didn't know when would be the next time I would find myself in a Scottish bar. Since they all looked the same to me, I just picked the Belhaven Best, the best Scottish ale apparently. Famished from castle exploration, I also ordered a warm sandwich.  The beer was fantastic. I don't know if it's Scotland's best, but it was light and refreshing. The sandwich, I forget what it's called, was just as delightful. It had the perfect combination of brie, bacon, and tomato (correct me if I'm wrong). I almost forgot about the rain outside.  For the food and drinks at a reasonable price, I highly recommend careening down the Royal Mile towards this pub the next time you are in Edinburgh!",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped by this pub to grab a quick lunch after visiting the castle.  We were greeted by a very rude waitress.  I was ready to walk out but my husband wanted to stay to try them out. The pub itself gives you a very historical feel.  This is something that we normally don't find in the US.  However,  there's nothing special about the food here.",

    "text": "Absolute Gem! Love this pub.   Some of my friends have come to visit a couple of times and I always bring them back here. It started off just being on the way to the next pub during a little bit of a crawl we decided to do around Edinburgh but it turned out to be a place we wanted to stay.  Cosy atmosphere with an amazing selection of whisky and a good selection of gin as well. They have fantastic service and always seem up for helping. A number of different whisky tastings to choose from with a nice guide to go along with them. The beginner's guide is definitely worth going for first to have a go and delve into it all. Atmosphere feels really honest and the food smelt good but we were there for drinks.  I will be back whenever someone visits but also for a rare selection of whisky ;)",

    "text": "We wandered into Ensign Ewart on the first night of our Scotland trip-- we had initially attempted to get into a restaurant we remembered from our honeymoon, but found it was impossible without a reservation, so we wandered into this little pub.  Lucky for us, it turned out to be a great find!  It's a cozy little place, and seemed to have a mix of locals and tourists.  The menu is pretty small, but I suspect it's all very good.  We both had the venison pie-- a delicious mix of slow-cooked venison, miscellaneous vegetables and mashed potatoes.  It was a steal at 10 or so, and beer was reasonable as well.  It does take them about 20 minutes to make, so don't order it if you're in a hurry, but you can't complain about food made from scratch!  They have TVs but not too loud, and our server was swamped but very nice.  There's so many places to choose from on the Royal Mile, but for a good pub meal at a very reasonable price, Ensign Ewart is worthy of consideration.",

Gave me recommendations and hooked me up. I'm now going to start drinking my gin with orange slices! Decent selection of brew on tap and bottled. There's something for everyone. Atmosphere was great with live music. Beware if you have a large-ish group though - it isn't a very large place. Great service and reasonable prices!",

I had the BLT and a latte to warm up. Service was speedy and the food and drinks were excellent. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.",

It was accompanied by a lovely bowl of olives, some hearty bread and four drams of whisky. I left warm, full, and utterly relaxed. Wish I could go daily. And the waitress was kind, friendly and pretty.",
