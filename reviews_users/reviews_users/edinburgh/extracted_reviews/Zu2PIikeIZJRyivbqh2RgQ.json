There isn't many places to sit so wouldn't recommend for more than 2/4 people unless you plan on taking away. The price is right and a soup and salad costing 8. The soup was flavourful and tummy warming. And the salad was Dank! (in a good way) fresh and tasty dressing makes the bowl the best!  Would definitely recommend to a friend.",

It's usually a vegetable chili or a curry). In my experience, whatever they offer, it tastes great.   The only downside: the hot food choices are a bit limited.",

I'd never tried a nut milk before, but the hazelnut paired perfectly with the warm, spicy chai. The latte was the perfect size and came in a nice big cup. It was absolutely delicious! Perfect for a chilly fall day.",

They have many options to go but also have a nice ambience inside to enjoy your meal. They have a wide variety of dairy free milks for coffee which I appreciate and also offer many vegan desserts which are excellent. The staff is incredibly kind and friendly and always strike up conversation. They are very helpful in offering recommendations as well! Highly, highly recommend!",

This is a super cute cafe ; very big with lots of seating and great lighting. So most of the food is in the refrigerator and the hot meal was a soup (when I was there). There are tons of teas, coffee beverages and unique beverages like the pumpkin spice latte and turmeric latte.    I got the signature pumpkin salad (forgot the actual name) and it had tons of beans, pumpkin pieces, kale, bell pepper and cayenne pepper with a pomegranate molasses dressing along with the turmeric latte. All the beverages are dairyfree and are made of either soy or coconut milk (they had a few other milks too). The meal was flavorful and tasted so very clean! I felt so full, but in the best way, after the salad. The turmeric latte was very good as well -- I was surprised that it paired well with the coconut milk! As a proponent and fan of turmeric (haldi) I was pleased with the fact you could actually taste the turmeric. The fact that they even had this was amazing!! Turmeric is so good for your health -- definitely try it out.   Will be back to try the smoothies and some of the raw sweets they offer!",

I'd been looking for a cafe which serves up this mysterious new health food trend and hadn't managed to find one until I stumbled upon Pumpkin Brown in the heart of the Grassmarket. The turmeric latte was everything I'd hoped for. I wasn't disappointed and came back for another lunch and latte a few days later.  If you're looking for top quality vegan food or just a really nutritious and hearty lunch, then Pumpkin Brown is your best bet in the area. I'm talking raw cakes and bakes and delicious whole grain salads. - Matcha and turmeric lattes if you're in the mood for a hot drink; coconut water and their own fruit infused waters if you're after something refreshing and cool. There's one hot meal per day; a fact that the staff have proudly told me each time I've visited. Both times, I went for the hot option and wasn't disappointed. - They were delicious and filling meals!  I like a little patter with my afternoon meal and Pumpkin Brown staff are happy to indulge in some chat, making this a really pleasant lunch stop.  Turmeric + coconut milk = turmeric latte heaven.",
