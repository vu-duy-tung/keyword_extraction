Anyways..If you read my other reviews for Chinese food, I'm usually disappointed, this place was far from dissapointing.   My chicken noodle soup was adequate but the gf's soup was much tastier.   My chicken satay was great but wasn't satay. It was spicy but not peanutty, who cares, it was good!   The gf's was not bad either and they were cooked to order as I waited and watched them being cooked whilst a birthday party (they have some seating) with a Chinese family was going on.

    "text": "Horrible experience, both my wife and I suffered from food poisoning. We ordered the mixed appetiser for two which was very greasy but then the chicken with pineapple was a disaster. I don't know if the chicken was not fresh or undercooked but the taste was really bad and my wife went directly to the bathroom. We didn't have a better experience with the house fried rice, the shrimp was almost raw, I barely touched the dish. Everything went directly to the garbage. We ordered that food for dinner and in the middle of the night I woke up with the terrible pain in the belly... Will never go back there again",
