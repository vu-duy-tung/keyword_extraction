The Chicken Jahlfrezi is recommended - but remember to take the chillies out if you don't want overkill heat!! The cooking is done right in front of you in the open plan kitchen which is good to watch while you wait.",

My partner has a nut allergy and the staff have always been willing to advise on what he can and cannot have. The chicken bhuna is particularly good. Great place!",
