    "text": "We went there twice for a special occasion and it never disappoints. The restaurant near Kings Theater is quite small, but cozy. There are bookshelves and paintings on the wall with a bar in the centre. The toilets are shared with a pub annexed. However, you won't notice the noise of the pub.  The food is unique and well prepared.  Last time I ordered pigeon for a starter and venison as the main. I was not able to manage the dessert.  The plates are not that full, but the food itself is very filling. I believe that they change the menu regularly what is a nice touch. You never get bored going there. You certainly get for what you pay for. They also serve unique Cocktails alla la petit mort. The service is very efficient.  We never had to wait long for the food. All perfectly timed.  We will be back!",

    "text": "As part of a surprise birthday dinner we were indeed pleasantly surprised to be seated at la Petit Mort.   There was a really warm welcome and we were very well taken care of.  The girl serving us was extremely knowledgeable and could explain drinks and dishes to the finest detail, including little enticing morsels of flavour explanations.   They serve a menu of 3 starter, mains and desserts.  The highlight for myself was indeed the rare cooked flat iron steak.  Perfectly cooked and extremely tender.   Their cocktail list is a joy to read. They do offer a large range of classic cocktails made to measure and personal preferences. I was very pleased with my earl grey old fashioned (though I personally prefer the single large rock of ice)  My biggest surprise was how reasonable the prices are compared to other places of similar quality (Kitchin, Scan & Scally et al) The food and service is certainly up to par. Sure these other places have won awards, but I did experience a similar (if not BETTER) experience in la Petit Mort - and as they are just starting out they may collect their rewards later on.   Highly recommended and certainly worthy of revisiting often.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my recent visit here with a group of friends. I've been once before and the food didn't disappoint me then, so I was looking forward to the dinner. We received a warm welcome from the waitress who brought menus and some water for the table.  For starter, I chose the pan fried wood pigeon which was tasty. A surprise ingredient in the dish was saffron roasted peanuts which went quite nicely. Main course was 'trio of beef' - flat iron steak, braised ox cheek and oxtail sausage roll. I can't fault anything, it was all delicious and I polished the lot. At this point I was quite full and could've skipped dessert - but I simply couldn't when I spotted creme brulee on the menu (toffee apple creme brulee)! It was divine and I had a irish coffee to finish the meal.  Small, intimate restaurant with friendly service and delicious food. What more could you want :)",

    "text": "La Petit Mort just seemed to look like one of those snug, romantic little places to tuck yourself away with someone and have a lovely few hours with. Which is exactly what I did, catching up with a good friend. The great thing - you are not rushed out of the door at any point, and can spend as little, or as long as you want to there. I would say something cheesy like 'J'Adore Petit Mort', but that just sounds plain weird, so lets not.  I decided to go all in, and have the parsnip brulee to start. This was the only bum note of the evening, as part of the brulee was warm, part was stone cold, and it didn't really feel right to be so cold, even with our hostess insisting that was right. I'm guessing it sat under a heater, which made it a little odd, even though technically the flavours were great, I was left feeling a little disconcerted.   For the mains, my dining partner opted for the venison, while I went for the smoked bean chilli. Now, I'd had chilli for lunch too, so it did feel like I was going to be underwhelmed by my main through sheer repetitiveness, but the dish was fantastic (beats the canteen version all day, every day) and I enjoyed every mouthful. Sadly though, I was too full to eat anything more, and I had been really looking forward to trying the desserts out, specifically the Raspberry Bavarois. However, my friend was wise, and had skipped a starter in order to make sure there was room for dessert, opting for the Assiette of Chocolate - which I was allowed to sample, with care, of course. Rich, decadent, a splendid way to finish the night, and we rolled off into the September evening, our bellies full and our hearts happy. I'll be back for the Raspberry Bavarois another day.",

The food is delicious: fine dining at a reasonable price. There are only three starters, five mains, and three desserts to choose from but I still found it difficult to settle on what to eat. Everything sounds so good! The drinks menu is similarly well put together with some lovely sounding cocktails and loads of great bottles of wine.",
